This is just as the market interprets the positive economic data in relationship with oil price and other factors, in the midst of profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing. This will result in market players targeting fundamentally sound and dividend paying stocks in hope of dividend announcements, as inflation rate moderates at 15.60 per cent and fourth quarter GDP up at 3.98 per cent. Analysts Optimism According to Cordros Securities Limited, “this week, we expect the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) floor to be flooded with corporate earnings as more companies publish their audited 2021FY numbers, accompanied by dividend declarations. “As things stand, we believe investors have fully priced-in dividend expectations. Hence, we think positive surprises from dividend-paying stocks would provide a catalyst for increased buying activities. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” In the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited expected the equities market to witness speculative buys ahead of year end corporate releases particular for companies which opted for 60-days filing option. Overall, we anticipate that the bourse will close in the bullish territory. Also, analysts at Afrinvest Limited said: “in the coming week, we expect the market to sustain the positive performance, albeit, modestly.” Last Week’s Trading Activities Positive sentiments returned to the local bourse last week as investors took advantage of the moderation in share prices prior week to make re-entries into companies with attractive dividend yields.
