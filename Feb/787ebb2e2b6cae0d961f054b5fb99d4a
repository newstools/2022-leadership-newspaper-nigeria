The NIMASA DG speaking against the backdrop of a Nigerian flagged Motor Vessel, MV VIGEO ADEBOLA which was reportedly distressed midstream Federal Ocean Terminal Onne due to operational error has been moved to a better location clear away from the FOT Onne Channel. MV Vigeo Adebola had a port list on 10th February, 2022 due to the fact that it received potable fresh water from a barge and it received all in the port fresh water tank. The vessel owners were able to correct the list on the 13thFebruary, 2022 by transferring some of the potable fresh water to the starboard side in order to have an even keel. od, the Surveyors from NIMASA constantly monitored the vessel until the operation was completed and the vessel relocated. It is noteworthy that at no point was the vessel having a negative metacentric height and vessel owners and captains are assured of safety of navigation on the Channel. “Let me use this opportunity to assure vessel owners, captains and all stakeholders, of the Agency’s commitment to its mandate, which includes maritime safety, geared towards safety of navigation of vessels in Nigerian territorial waters,” Jamoh said.
