The commencement of the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE) registrations earlier scheduled for Saturday, February 12, 2022, has now been postponed to Saturday, February 19, 2022. With the new date, the exercise will now end on Saturday, March 26, 2022. The head, public affairs and protocol of JAMB, Dr Fabian Benjamin, said the one-week postponement was to allow for more fine-tuning of the upgraded and more user-friendly procedures for candidates’ registration. “The process, which will be concluded within the one-week extension period, is also aimed at accommodating feedbacks from candidates and other stakeholders alike. “The Board wishes the general public to note that the Board is ever-ready to provide world-class services to Nigerians. “Further to the above, the new and improved procedures for the 2022 UTME Registration would be made available on the Board’s website, its weekly bulletin as well as other media outlets on Monday, 14th February, 2022,” he said. The JAMB spokesman, therefore, urged candidates to follow keenly the procedures for registration as would be announced by the Board.
