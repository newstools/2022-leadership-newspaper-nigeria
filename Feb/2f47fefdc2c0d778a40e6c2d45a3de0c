Eba made the assertion when he hosted a delegation of the National Executive Council (NEC) members of the support group in his residence in Abuja. He commended the foresight and vision of the APC-NSSF, saying it is one of the pillars of the party in Nigeria due to its membership that cuts across the country and the diaspora. Eba, who was appointed the national technical adviser of South South zone, said the party would benefit immensely from the political group especially on voters’ mobilisation. Earlier, the national chairman the APC-NSSF Yusuf Ardo said the group had developed its strategic plan to engage with all contestants for positions in the party at all levels to ensure the best amongst the lots are chosen by the party. According to him, the group is committed to consulting widely with the key stakeholders to support APC candidate as agreed by the party.
