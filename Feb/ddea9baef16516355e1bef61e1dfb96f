Mohammed emphatically declared that APC’s zoning of presidency to the South, which is targeted at throwing up the party’s national leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will definitely pose no threat to his party, the PDP. The Bauchi governor, who himself is aspiring to clinch the PDP’s presidential ticket for the year 2023 general elections, made the disclosure while speaking with journalists on Wednesday in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital shortly after emerging from a closed – door meeting with former President Olusegun Obasanjo at his private residence located within the precinct of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Abeokuta. Mohammed, who described Chief Obasanjo as, “an elder statesman per excellence with a lot of wisdom”, said PDP would continue to strategize towards rescuing Nigeria from the present situation the country has found herself. Mohammed emphatically stated that since each of the political parties is trying to “strategize, plan and organise”, PDP will not hesitate at throwing its presidential ticket to whichever zone that will give the party the opportunity to emerge victorious when the time comes. “If they zone to the South, it is open to us to see how it is going to give us more electoral victory, or if we put it to the North it will give us more electoral victory. “This is the kind of thing we are doing; the leg works, the permutations and so and so forth. So that, at least, whatever we are going to do, is to give us and provide for Nigerians to choose between the best alternatives.”
