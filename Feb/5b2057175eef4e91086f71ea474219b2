Indeed, ‘positive peace’, defined as the ‘attitudes, institutions and structures that create and sustain peaceful societies’ (IEP 2021), and seen as an ‘optimal environment for human potential to flourish’, has to be cultivated and nurtured to grow to desirable ideal.  Peaceful coexistence and national Unity are desirable goals for all nations, but especially ethnically and religiously diverse nations, for sustainable progress and development. If attained, these strengthen a nation’s pursuit of collective aspirations. Peaceful coexistence presupposes that citizens of a country voluntarily establish bonds and cooperate and work together in harmony, in spite of differences, for collective societal progress, sustainability and reproduction. These however, are not easy to have, especially in very diverse countries, such as Nigeria, due to ethno-linguistic differences, and social and religious identities, which ordinarily foster and bolster “prejudice and obstinacy” Pilkington 1956: 219) and which are susceptible to mobilization and manipulation by self-serving ethno-religious elite, and mismanagement by incompetent and parochial ‘leaders’. Ethno-religious diversity in itself is not necessarily a problem; indeed, it can be a significant asset. The challenge arises when elite mobilize and weaponize these identities in reckless pursuit of self-serving objectives. In contexts, such as Nigeria’s, positive peace and national unity have to be deliberately forged, nurtured and entrenched, through citizenship mobilization, sensitization and education, as well as through policies and programmes for actualizing the goal of unity in diversity and national integration, which de-emphasize what divides, and emphasizes what unites. To catalyse and achieve peace, there must, necessarily, be a sense of belonging by all citizens. Peace has to be cultivated, nurtured and nourished and unity has to be forged, in spite of differences occasioned by diversity. The question is: who is to cultivate, nurture, nourish peaceful coexistence and unity in a federation, with diverse ethno-linguistic, as well as religious diversity? Abstractly, the state, through government policy, legislation, adherence to the rule of law, has a major responsibility. This is in the sense that the major role of the state, through its institutions, agents and agencies, is to protect citizens’ lives and properties; protect the territorial integrity of the country; adjudicate in disputes on the basis of the rule of law; and provide, if not guarantee, human security. In reality, leaders who preside over / manage the state, bear the primary responsibility. This is especially in a liberal democratic dispensation, when people through the electoral process elect leaders as representatives in the governance processes. Other leaders/elite, recognized as such, in communities, in civil society and associational life outside of the state, and within families, also have, albeit secondary, responsibility. In Nigeria, especially in the past 21 years of transition to democracy, there has been an evident leadership crisis, a deficit in leadership selection and recruitment, which has negatively affected the nurturing and consolidation of peaceful coexistence and national unity, with dire negative consequences, as the following contextual analysis portrays. Contextual Analysis: Nigeria is a country, which presently (2022) has an estimated population of 216 million people, made up of over 250 ethnic and over 500 linguistic groups (See CIFORB Country Profile – Nigeria) and at least 3 categories of religious affiliations. There is in present day Nigeria evidence of remarkable erosion of peace and national unity and seeming whittling down if not abandonment of yester-years lofty projects of national integration. The resurgence of, and violent activism by, insurgents and irredentist militants with a clear agenda for dismemberment of Nigeria, is indicative of the sorry state of peaceful coexistence, national unity and integration. So is the increasingly indifferent and apathetic disposition of teeming youth with regards to serious national affairs, which ordinarily would require their active engagement. Indeed, many young men and women are so frustrated that they are diverting their energies to aggressive behaviour and creativity to all sorts of criminality. Whether it is ‘area boys’, ‘yandaba’, Yahoo! Boys’, ‘sara-suka’ herders, bandits, ‘yan kallare’, ‘freedom fighters’, militants  or terrorists, overwhelming majority of them are young men and, to an extent, also women. Some young men and women have even given up on Nigeria and are merely looking for opportunities to “check-out”. Nigeria is currently ranked among the most fragile states on the Fragile States Index (2021), with a score of 98.0; ranking no 12 out of 179 countries. It also ranks lowly on the Global Peace Index (2022), on account of pervasive conflicts and violence, and evident incapacity of the state to address effectively these. Nigeria ranks number 147 out of 163 countries, with a score of 2.865. There are, identified 8 pillars of peace in modern nation states, as follows: Source: https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu In Nigeria, regrettably, these pillars are virtually absent or grossly deficient. This situation needs to be effectively and decisively addressed. Peaceful coexistence and imperative of national unity are of such importance that the challenges undermining and obstructing them can no longer be ignored, and that all hands need to, have to, be on deck to find lasting solutions to them. No doubt, Nigeria has been searching for, and grappling with the issues of, peaceful coexistence and national unity since its formation….  with the 1914 Amalgamation. The British colonial rulers came to the realization that administering the conquered and subjugated territories as separate colony and protectorates was not costeffective. Even after Amalgamation and the formation of Nigeria, managing the vast territory as relatively autonomous grouping of provinces into regions was problematic and unsatisfactory. Hence through one of a series of constitutional enactments, in 1954 under the MacPherson’s Constitution, the British turned Nigeria into a Federation, for easier management of diversity. Indeed, it was meant to forge “unity in diversity” a core objective of modern federations. Newly independent Nigeria’s leaders, in the immediate post-independence period, with their political power bases ensconced in relatively autonomous regions, seem to have busied themselves more with “forgetting” or “trying to understand” their differences rather than concretely forging national unity in diversity. Within each region as their individual areas of influence, however, they forged unity, nurtured a relatively united, or at least accommodative, regional identity, and created a regional sense of belonging much more than a national sense of belonging and unity. The phenomenon of military rule initially threatened and almost destroyed whatever sense or perception of national unity or unity in diversity existed, leading to the 1967-70 civil war with devastating consequences. However, after the civil war, the then military rulers paid significant attention to, not only “reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction” in the immediate post-war period, but also and especially forging “national unity”, “unity in diversity” and national integration. They introduced notable programmes and projects, such as the NYSC scheme, in which tertiary education graduates are posted out of their states of origins or even regions for one-year compulsory national service, so that they can live in other areas, learn other cultures and traditions, establish enduring friendships and relationships and help accelerate the goal of national integration. In addition, the military regimes established federal government to laid the foundation for heightened mutual suspicions and fears, and even, in many respects, the erosion of national unity and integration. For example, the introduction of the federal character principle in employment into federal service, and the quota system of admissions into tertiary institutions, although undergirded by lofty principles of affirmative action and advancement of equality of opportunity, given the manner in which they were executed, created ethno-religious and regional tensions and animosities based on actual, as well as, perceptions of exclusion, discrimination and marginalization, resulting in significant erosion of national sense of belonging and national unity. In any case, the attention paid to the question of national unity and integration by successive military regimes has not been matched by successive civilian administrations. Except for sloganeering in the Third Republic, when Shehu Shagari as NPN’s presidential candidate, and subsequently as president, popularised the slogan of “One Nation, One Destiny”, subsequent civilian administrations, especially since 1999 seem to have, more or less, presided over the undermining if not destruction of the bases and foundations of national unity and integration in Nigeria. To be sure, peaceful coexistence and national unity can only be predicated on mutual trust and understanding, reciprocal friendly/brotherly/sisterly relations, as well as shared interests, values and aspirations. National unity would only best be promoted through tolerance and accommodation of each other’s differences, opinions, ethnic, religious and communal or even regional identities. At the core of national unity are non-discriminatory relations whether at the personal or official levels. The sad thing in that in contemporary Nigeria, all these are in dire short supply. Currently, the major threats to national unity, which undermine peaceful coexistence, as well as national security, could be summarized as follows:  Nigeria, regrettably, operates a distorted and dysfunctional form of federalism, in which the core principles of peaceful coexistence and unity in diversity are undermined, rather than nurtured and entrenched. Of the 25 or so federations in the contemporary world, representing about 40 % of the global population, Nigeria is arguably the most unstable, with the worst example of poor management of diversity (see Jega, 2021b). This negative trend needs to be reversed. But it can only be done, by having elected leaders who are democrats and not ‘militicians’, who understand what the value of operating a functional rather than dysfunctional federal arrangement is, for peace, stability, unity, progress and development of a country, and who have the ability, capacity, competence and integrity to drive good democratic governance for the polity. It is worthy of restating that, Nigeria is currently craving for repositioning of the leadership recruitment process by political parties, such that we bring into the electoral and governance arenas people of good character; honest, selfless and sincere people with requisite integrity and competence to decisively move the country forward in all ramifications, but especially on a trajectory towards good democratic governance. That would be a panacea to our federal, as well as overall governance challenges, and pave way for citizens sense of belonging and inclusive participation, all of which would enhance national unity and peaceful coexistence.  Imperative of forging Peaceful Coexistence and Unity in Diversity: Peaceful coexistence and Unity in diversity are core principles of federalism. All federations are required to adhere to, and actively nurture and entrench, expectations associated with these core principles. Nigeria, as a federation with a complex mosaic of diversity need to continue to find, and deploy, ways and means of forging, entrenching and sustaining peaceful coexistence, as well as expanding the scope of unity in diversity and national integration, beyond sloganeering and ‘lip-service’ by leaders in governance positions at all levels. Elected national leaders in particular need to “walk the talk” of national unity and integration, through the formulation and execution of sustainable policies, programmes and projects on national unity and integration. Nigeria’s stability, peaceful coexistence and sustainability as a federation would depend on how purposefully, effectively and seriously these are done.  A decade ago, the Federal Government of Nigeria published the National Peace Policy (2012) under the auspices of the Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution, which was itself created in 2002. The need for the Policy, as articulated in the publication, was necessitated by:  … recent violent conflicts that have, among others, threatened the country’s corporate existence, inflicted untold humanitarian tragedies, including wanton killings and destruction of property and large number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs); increasingly undermined the survival of [Nigeria’s] democracy; and have precluded the minimum conditions for the pursuit of development and advancement of the collective well-being of [Nigeria’s] population.  This policy document, like many others, seems to have been filed away on shelves, collecting dust, like many others, due to the kind of leadership our country has. Very few, if any, of the significant recommendations contained in the Peace Policy have been seriously implemented.  In the present circumstances, given the pitiable state of peaceful existence and the drastic erosion of national cohesion and, indeed, the reckless tearing of the national fabric the actions and inactions of reckless elite in public leadership positions, a lot needs to be done to promote peaceful coexistence and unity among the various ethnoreligious groups in Nigeria. In this regard, some pertinent recommendations can be highlighted.  Recommendations As a starting point, there must be a solid commitment by elected leaders at all levels of governance to uphold, protect and defend the Rule of Law. All citizens must be seen to be equal before the law. In particular, elected leaders must uphold the constitutional provisions pertaining to citizenship rights, and ensure that all citizens have equal 10 rights where ever they reside in Nigeria. State governors in particular must not in any way discriminate against any citizen and must not prioritize perceived / so-called indigenous ‘rights’ over citizenship rights. A qualification for residency may be introduced, in accordance with the best practices in federations globally. For example, once a citizen of Nigeria moves into any state and becomes a resident tax payer in the state for at least 3 to 5 years, he or she should be entitled to the rights and obligations of every other citizen in that state, regardless of ‘indigenous’ status. Doing this would create and entrench a sense of belonging, increase the scope of national unity, and engender peaceful coexistence.  Then, our elected leaders have to focus attention on improving our federal system for greater functionality, effectiveness and sustainability. This can be done, as I have been advocating recently, by plucking at what I call the low-hanging fruits of restructuring (Jega 2021, a & b).  Other things that are recommended to be done so as to nurture and entrench national unity, integration and sustainable peace and stability include:         Conclusion There is no doubt that, given the imperative of peaceful coexistence and unity in a diverse federal system, and in particular, the current dysfunctional nature of the Nigerian federation, patriotic Nigerians have an obligation to strategically identify effective ways and means of forging national unity in diversity, so as to restore stability, enhance 12 peaceful coexistence, and sustained socioeconomic, as well as democratic development. This is a task that must be done. And in this task, everybody has a role and all hands must be on deck. The state has to be repositioned by electing people of good character, with competence and patriotic zeal into leadership positions and under the framework of good, democratic governance. The elite need to develop consensus on reforming both the convoluted leadership recruitment process, which has been captured by a rabidly reckless small faction of the elite, and the structure of the Nigerian federation, to ensure speedy and effective actualization of this desired goal, as soon as possible, and no later than the 2023 general elections. As has been aptly recognized, “building and sustaining peace requires a large number of society-wide improvements progressing in concert with one another over a long period of time” (IEP 2021). Only competent capable, selfless and patriotic leaders, who additionally have good, positive values (ethical, professional, moral) can direct national affairs in such a manner as to bring this about. Nigerians must strive hard to recruit such leaders at all levels of governance in the 2023 general elections.  *** Professor Jega is of the Department of Political Science, Bayero University, Kano.
