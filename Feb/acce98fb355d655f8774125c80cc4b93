Senegal President, Macky Sall, has declared Monday a public holiday to celebrate the national team’s first-ever Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) win following their victory against Egypt, public television announced. Sall, who had been due to visit Comoros at the end of a trip that took him to Egypt and Ethiopia, cancelled the last leg of the planned trip in order to welcome the triumphant Lions on their return to Dakar on Monday, RTS said. Led by Liverpool star, Sadio Mane, Senegal overcame Mohamed Salah’s Egypt 4-2 in a penalty shoot-out at Sunday’s final in Cameroon. After two previous final defeats in 2002 and 2019, Senegal finally claimed their first AFCON title. The Lions will be decorated by Sall on Tuesday at the presidential palace in Dakar, RTS television said. “The president of the republic declared Monday a public holiday, a paid day off, following the brilliant victory of the Lions,” RTS said, citing a presidential decree.
