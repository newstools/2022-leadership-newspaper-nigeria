To increase voluntary tax compliance, management of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has introduced ‘self-service stations’ where taxpayers can file tax returns, pay taxes, apply for and validate tax clearance certificates among other services by themselves. The online platform is located in FIRS tax offices across the country. The initiative is aimed at supporting taxpayers in the optimised use of the TaxPro Max solution, the FIRS said in a statement that was issued yesterday. “As part of the Service’s effort to enhance voluntary tax compliance, the SelfService Stations will, among other things, provide taxpayers the opportunity to carry out the following services online while in the Tax Office: Filing tax returns; Paying taxes; Applying for and validate TCCs; Generating receipts and credit notes,” the statement said. The statement added that to make it more convenient for the taxpayers, the Self-Service Stations have designated officers readily available to assist taxpayers with any technical difficulty or concerns that may arise. The tax watchdog urged taxpayers to take advantage of the Self-Service Stations in fulfilling their tax obligations.
