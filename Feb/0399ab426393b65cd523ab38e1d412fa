Nigerian stock trading, this week, would be guided by the release of 2021 corporate results and dividend declarations expected to hit the market. The domestic stock market is expected to close positive this week, as more listed companies publish their audited 2021 full year results and with the declaration of their dividend payouts. Analysts’ Optimism Analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited are expecting the equities market to be bullish as corporates that opted for 60 days filing option have started releasing their audited full year 2021 results with stimulating dividend payouts. Analysts at Cordros Securities Limited said: “this week, we expect the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) floor to be flooded with corporate earnings as more companies publish their audited 2021 full year numbers, accompanied by dividend declarations. “We believe this would provide a catalyst for buying activities even as risk-averse investors are likely to remain cautious due to medium-term expectations of an uptick in fixed income (FI) yields.  Overall, we advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” To Afrinvest Limited,  “this week, we anticipate that bargain purchase activities would drive a modest positive performance in the market.” Last Week’s Trading Activities Last week was a keenly contested battle between the bulls and the bears as mixed sentiments dominated trading activities on the local bourse.
