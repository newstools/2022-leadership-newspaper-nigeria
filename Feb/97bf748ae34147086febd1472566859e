The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State has accused the State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, of allegedly wasting over N250 million public fund on the launching of his book in Abuja on Thursday. The PDP alleged that two aircrafts were chartered to ferry over 200 people from Akure Airport to Abuja on Wednesday, asking what benefits the people of Ekiti will derive from the book. State publicity secretary of the PDP, Raphael Adeyanju, in a statement in Ado Ekiti on Thursday, said “it is funny that Governor Fayemi, who has envisioned nothing in Ekiti is wasting public funds to launch a book on envisioning a New Nigeria. “What manner of a new Nigeria can an absentee governor like Fayemi, whose first four years plunged Ekiti into debt, with borrowed money used to execute projects on billboards, envision for Nigeria?” The PDP said apart from wasting public funds, government activities were paralysed since Wednesday that all political appointees and top civil servants were ferried to Abuja at the expense of Ekiti treasury just to witness the book launch. The party, which described the book launch as declaration of Fayemi’s presidential ambition, said Nigerians will have to ask him how secured he has made Ekiti to think that he can rule Nigeria. “In Ekiti here, traveling from one town to another has become a nightmare because of bandits and all roads are bad (Akure to Ekiti, no road). Nothing to point to as achievement of his government. Yet, he is jumping up and down, wasting public funds on a presidential ambition that is bound to fail. “Rather than hiding under book launch to declare his presidential ambition, why can’t the governor just come straight by telling Nigerians how well he has performed in Ekiti to qualify him to govern Nigeria?”
