Stakeholders of All Progressives Congress (APC) from the South South geopolitical zone are seeking the national secretary position ahead of the party’s national convention slated for 26th of this month. The South East APC stakeholders are also scrambling for the position of the APC national secretary, with two aspirants from Anambra State, Amb Jerry Ugokwe and Hon Chidi Duru, already campaigning for the post. While former national organising secretary of APC, Senator Osita Izunaso is also said to have indicated interest in the position, some stakeholders are arguing that former National Working Committee (NWC) members should not be reelected into the incoming leader of the party. But the South South stakeholders premised their demand on the contention that the South East had held and is still holding the National Secretary of a major party. Accordingly, they appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari and leadership of the party to consider the South South for the APC national secretary position. They said those that served before should let go just like what happened in the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) where no former NWC member was elected into the Working Committee. Speaking on zoning, Hon Abel Akpan from Cross River State said the party should consider the South South for the APC National Secretary. He said, “The South East geopolitical zone has held the position of National Secretary of a ruling party, right from the days of Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo as PDP National Secretary. After Nwodo came Prince Vincent Ogbulafor, late Chief Ojo Maduekwe and some others.” Akpan pointed out that the present national secretary of PDP, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, is from the South East geopolitical zone. The APC chieftain who spoke on behalf of the stakeholders said zoning the position of the APC national secretary to South South would consolidate the party in the zone.
