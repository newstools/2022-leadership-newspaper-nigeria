ICT services provider in Nigeria, Galaxy Backbone Limited (GBB), said it regretted the temporary outage of some of its services and the inconvenience being experienced by some of its customers across the country. In a statement signed by its Head of Corporate Communications, Chidi Okpala, copy of which was made available to LEADERSHIP on Tuesday, GBB said it was working assiduously to restore the services. “Across the organization, the highest priority classification has been assigned and all hands are on deck to ensure resolution is achieved within the shortest possible time,” Okpala said. He noted that GBB has assembled a highly skilled technical team of experienced Engineers and Application experts that will not just solve the current issue but put in place all the necessary structures to ensure that such an incident never occur again in the future. “While a good number of the services have been restored, efforts are being made to restore all the other services of its customers,” he added. Okpala, therefore, assured that the organisation would continually reach out to all its valued customers by providing them with necessary updates until all the services are completely restored.
