Hundreds of residents and property owners of Olawolede Oruola Community, a satellite town of Abeokuta metropolis, in the Abeokuta North Local Government on Wednesday, stormed the streets of Abeokuta in protest against the invasion and demolition of their properties by land grabbers claiming to be new owners in the area. Led by the chairman, Lawal Ibrahim, the protesters, under the aegis of Olawolede Oruola Community Development Association carried placards bearing different inscriptions and chanted anti-land grabbing choruses to draw the attention of the government to their plight. They however, passionately appealed to the state governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun to save them from the harassments of the land grabbers whom they said laid siege on their community daily under the pretext of reclaiming the land. Speaking with newsmen on Wednesday at the scene of the demolition allegedly being carried out by the land grabbers, Lawal alleged that leader of the land grabbers, one Taofeq Akintunde have been using police operatives from the Ogun state Police Command to harass and intimidate them over the land and forcefully ejected them out. Flanked by other members of the CDA, Lawal explained that one of the real estate and property developing agent in the state, OBATOB approached property owners in the community, ordering them to vacate their respective houses on the ground that it has acquired the property from the leader of the land grabbers, Akintunde. The CDA chairman further explained that the property company in question forcefully ejected them out of their homes, using an earth moving machine, a bulldozer to demolish their buildings, even while some property owners were still inside the buildings, claiming that the 1, 000 hectares of land it acquired from leader of the land grabbers traverses their community. As at the time LEADERSHIP visited the community, the earth moving machine, along other billboards erected by the land grabbers were still seen on several positions of the community, while beacons used by different property owners to demarcate their respective boundaries have been removed.
