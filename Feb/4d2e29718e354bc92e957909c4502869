Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have arrested Nigerian musicians, Zinoleesky and Mohbad, after a raid on their residence by midnight in Lagos. The operatives recovered some banned substances namely Cannabis and Molly at their residence. NDLEA spokesman, Femi Babafemi, who confirmed the arrest, said, “Our men raided an area in Idado estate where Bịara Market boys stay. Some quantities of Cannabis sativa and Molly were recovered from their apartment and car. Six persons were arrested in all. Two females and four males.” This arrest is coming weeks after the anti-narcotics agency also arrested fast-rising skit maker, De General, after a raid on his residence in Lagos. The skit maker was charged to court where he was convicted of trafficking tramadol and Cannabis sativa. De General was, however, pardoned by the court on the grounds that the quantity of the drugs found on him was too small to earn him a sentence.
