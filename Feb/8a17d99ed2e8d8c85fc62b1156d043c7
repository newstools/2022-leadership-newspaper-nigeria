North Central Women Forum(NCWF) converged on Kaduna today and resolved to work with their hard earn resources to ensure that Enugu State Governor, Mr. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi is elected President come 2023. The women forum said the decision to declare support for governor Ugwuanyi, popularly called “Gburugburu” is the manner he has been able to entrench peace and good governance in Enugu as well as assist women and the downtrodden to grow their businesses. The women forum with members drafted from Niger, Kwara, Nasarawa, Plateau,  Benue, Kogi States  and Federal Capital Territory (FCT) held a “Crucial Meeting on Who to Support during the forthcoming 2023 election” at Epitome Hotel, Barnawa, Kaduna State with a call on all Nigerians  to support power shift to the Igbos , because it is long overdue. According to the forum, the decision to hold the meeting in Kaduna was strategic for the  mothers, who expressed  worries over  threats of political divisions; insecurity, high rate of poverty and unemployment, and socio-ecomomic problems militating progress and development of Nigeria under the President Buhari led APC administration. In a communique jointly  signed by the Coordinator of the Forum , issued after the crucial  meeting , the North Central Women Forum resolved to throw their weight behind Governor Ugwuanyi, whom they described  as the most women friendly governor and Detribalised leader. The nine point communique jointly  signed by Coordinator and Secretary of the North Central Women Forum,  Christian Solomon Azege and Secretary Hajiya Amina Kure, stated:  “ He is currently the only governor of a state, who came on board and remembered the welfare of the women , traders and the downtrodden . “One of the  reasons we resolved to endorse  Governor Ugwuanyi as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria come 2023 is  because of his far reaching  Traders Empowerment Scheme launched in 2017 to assist genuine women traders and various businesses, irrespective of state of origin, religion or ethnicity.
