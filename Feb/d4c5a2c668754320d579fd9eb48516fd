Commercial banks in Uromi town, the headquarters of Esan North-East local government area of Edo State, yesterday evening came under attacks as armed robbers launched coordinated attacks on the financial institutions. A resident of the sprawling community, the home town of the late chairman of PDP Board of Trustees, BOT, Chief Tony Anenih, said the attacks on the banks were well coordinated. The source, who pleaded anonymity, described the attacks as “too coordinated in commando style and the armed robbers launched the attacks simultaneously. This is novel in this town.” Other sources in the town listed the affected banks to include first and second generation banks. “The sporadic shots by the armed robbers caused panic in the town. The robbers came prepared. People were just running helter-skelter”, another source said. Residents were said to be making contact with security agencies to come to the rescue of the banks and the residents. Meanwhile, when contacted, the Edo State Police Command public relations officer, PPRO, Kontongs Bello, confirmed the attacks and also confirmed that seven persons were killed. He said the dead were five civilians and two policemen.
