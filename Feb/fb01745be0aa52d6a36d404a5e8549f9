They made the call at the recent Nairametrics’ 2022 Economic Outlook webinar with the theme, “Your Money, the Economy and Government Policies.” FS Leader, PWC West Africa, Andrew Nevin, who was one of the panelists at the webinar, explained that Nigeria needed to improve the business environment to drive growth and development. Nevin stressed the need to drive export growth through services, unlock dead assets, move informal businesses to the formal sector and harness the power of the Diaspora, among others. He noted that digitisation of tax system was in the right direction to increase tax revenue. Nevin, however, noted that raising taxes would be very problematic due to the challenges in the country occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. For his part, Head, Fixed Income, Currencies and Treasury, FBNQuest Merchant Bank, Adetoun Dosunmu, said inflation would be on the rise due to electioneering activities with increased money in circulation. Dosunmu predicted that interest rates would increase in the year due to high inflation rate and the need to fund the budget deficit. “If you want to attract FPI, you need to increase your interest rate. Rates will go up and there is a budget deficit to be funded and the suspension of subsidy removal will gulp another deficit of about N1.2 trillion,” she said. Also, speaking at the event, Liborous Oshoma, Head Attorney at the Liborous Oshoma Chambers, said the lingering VAT war between the federal government and states was not good for the economy. Oshoma suggested that the concerned parties should sit down at the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) and resolve the issue. Olufemi Babem, Partner, Tax, Regulatory and People Services at KPMG, said the VAT war issue should be solved without further delay. Babem said the governors and the president should sit down together and find a political solution to the issue. Speaking on the topic, ‘Economic impact of government’s tax revenue drive,’ he said that the 2022 budget deficit of N6.39 trillion needed to be funded, noting that the government would be aggressive in the revenue drive. He noted that the Finance Act, 2021 had many amendments that would increase domestic revenue mobilisation, tax administration and legislative drafting, international taxation and financial sector reforms as well as tax equity, among others. On expected fiscal changes, Babem said Nigerians should expect an increase in effective rate of tax on corporate profits by about 0.6 per cent, broadening the corporate income tax base for profit oriented educational institutions and foreign companies providing services to Nigerian beneficiaries. According to him, taxation of the digital economy such as Twitter, Microsoft and Netflix will expand Nigeria’s tax base. Babem noted that the government should deploy digitisation in tax collection to expand the country’s tax base instead of embracing constant tax increment. He called on Nigerians to prepare for increased tax authority action and review business and operating structure to optimise tax position.
