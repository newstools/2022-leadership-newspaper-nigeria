Finally the man on the line whose car was behind the one who was allowing the injustice, jumped out of his car, nearly throttling the guilty man who had climbed out of his car. It took the intervention of some security men at duty to prevent them exchanging blows. People where angry, I thought as I watched on. The security man was speaking calmly to both men who were still yelling at each other. The annoying part of it all was that the man who was trying to jump the line did not at all see what he was doing wrong and was still doing, what we call ‘Bold Face’. The weather was sweltering hot and people on the queue were frustrated and angry that they had to be here on the long queue, not to mention the present unpleasant economic situation. The other man who was going to allow the other man get in front of him, pretended not to know what was happening when everything escalated, and now the angry man behind him had turned on him to accuse him of wanting to disrupt the queue by allowing the man who had just come to jump the line.
