Dangote Group has said, the truck involved in Ogun accident does not belong to the organisation. The group, in a statement to LEADERSHIP, yesterday said, its attention has been drawn to some online media reports that a truck conveying petroleum product, which was involved in a fatal crash that claimed several lives, belongs to Dangote Flour, saying, the truck bearing the logo of Dangote Flour was said to have been involved in an accident in Ogun State. “However, contrary to a report by the Federal Road Safety Commission, the said truck does not belong to the Dangote Group. It should be noted that Olam International Limited, makers of Crown Flour products, acquired Dangote Flour in 2019 in a widely publicised deal. The company now fully belongs to Olam. “The loss of lives in this instance is regrettable and saddening. The public is advised to take note of this clarification,” the statement said.
