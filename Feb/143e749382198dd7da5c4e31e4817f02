The court gave the order in his ruling on an ex-parte application by a lawyer to the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC), Osuobeni Ekoi Akponimisingha. Justice Egwuatu said the interim order granted would last for 60 days to enable the ICPC to conclude its investigation, following which the commission could apply for final forfeiture. The judge ordered the ICPC to publicise the order for any person or persons with interest in the affected properties to show cause within 14 days why they should not be permanently forfeited to the Federal Government. Some of the properties, which allegedly belong to Yari, according to the ICPC, are in Maryland (USA), Abuja, Kaduna, among others.
