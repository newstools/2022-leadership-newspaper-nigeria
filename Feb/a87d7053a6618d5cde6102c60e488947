No fewer than 715 delegates will today elect the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress(APC), in the forthcoming bye-election of the Akure North/ Akure South federal constituency. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had picked February 1 for the bye-election following the death of Adedayo Omolafe, popularly known as Expensive in August 2021.
