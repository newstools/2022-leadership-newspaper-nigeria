The cables and wires manufacturer launched the bond programme, with Coronation Merchant Bank as lead issuing house on the transaction at its head office in Ogun State. The head of Investment Banking at Coronation Merchant Bank, Suru Daniels, stated that, the firm had to set up a special purpose vehicle, Coleman Funding SPV Plc, to access the capital market without compromising its governance as a private firm.
