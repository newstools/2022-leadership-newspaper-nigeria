Speaking at the press conference yesterday heralding the event (boat race), president of Nigeria Rowing, Canoe and Sailing Federation (NRCSF), Admiral FBI Porbeni, said a total of 13 states including host FCT, Ondo, Kogi, Rivers, Delta, Borno, Bayelsa, Oyo, Kaduna, Kwara, Bauchi and Niger as well as independent athletes will compete for medals in 15 events in both able and para categories. He said the competition which is designed to catch them young and nurture them to stardom is also aiming to propagate the three water sports – rowing, canoe and sailing toward helping the NRCSF achieve its core mandate of developing and popularizing water sports in the country. Porbeni also revealed that the NRCSF is working tirelessly to improve on the technical and organisational efficiency of the championship to attract support from the International Canoe Federation (ICF) and International Rowing Federation (FISA), saying this will authenticate new records set, created or broken by the athletes in the competition. He showered encomium on Nigerian sensation and Olympian, Ayomide Emmanuel Bello, who broke her own record of 50.00 seconds in the 200m women event at the Morocco 2019 Africa Games when she returned a faster time of 42.90 seconds in the same event at the 2021 Admiral Porbeni National Boat Race. He also announced that following the success of the competition, ICF has offered to support Nigeria to host the first edition of West Africa Para Canoeing and Rowing Championship at the Jabi Lake, Abuja immediately after the Admiral Porbeni National Boat Race. He said the NCRSF is determined to continue to do more to raise the standard of the competition, but incapacitate by low funding and call on corporate bodies and well-meaning Nigerians to support the Federation financially, saying the government alone cannot fund sports to the height Nigerians all desire. “May I use this medium to acknowledge and appreciate support received from our corporate sponsors, Embassies in Nigeria and Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development without which the successes recorded in this competition would not have been possible. “Let me therefore use this medium to call on corporate bodies, captains of industries and well-meaning Nigerians to support the Federation financially as we all know that the government alone cannot finance sports to the height we all desire.
