Following the weekly decline seen in the Nigerian stock market last week, the market is expected to move up with a marginal gain this week. Analysts Optimism In the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited expected the equities market to mellow as corporates that opted for 60-days filing option may release their audited full year 2021 results in the next two weeks; hence, feel the new week will largely be quiet. Cordros Capital Limited stated that, “this week, we expect investors to take advantage of the moderation in the share prices to make a re-entry in dividend-paying stocks ahead of subsequent 2021 full year earnings releases. However, we believe investors will remain reluctant to leave gains in the market. As such, we expect intermittent profit-taking to continue due to uncertainties about the direction of yields in the fixed income (FI) market. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Also, analysts at Afrinvest Limited stated that, “this week, we expect bargain hunting activities to dominate as investors cherry-pick relatively attractive stocks.” Last Week’s Trading Activities In the just concluded week, the bullish activities in the domestic equities market witnessed a halt as profit takers took over the Exchange to make real their paper gains. Investors appeared to be unsatisfied with the recently released Okomu Oil’s unaudited Q4, 2021 financial results, which showed a marginal decline in profit after tax. Thus, the market saw a 10 per cent week-on-week (W-o-W) decline in its share price to N127.80 per share. In line with the bearish trend, the All-Share Index moderated W-o-W by 0.16 per cent to close at 47,202.30 points. Similarly, the market capitalization shed N42 billion W-o-W to close at N25.436 trillion. Surprisingly, sub-sector gauges closed in green; the NGX Banking, NGX Insurance index, NGX Consumer Goods NGX Oil & Gas and the NGX Industrial indices rose by 2.34 per cent, 1.51 per cent, 1.35 per cent, 0.29 per cent and 0.06 per cent respectively to close at 453.45 points, 185.85 points, 579.00 points, 423.93 points and 2,138.30 points respectively.
