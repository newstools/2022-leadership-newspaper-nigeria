The chief press secretary to Benue State governor, Mr Nathaniel Ikyur, has declared that his principal, Dr. Samuel Ortom, does not hate President Muhammad Buhari. According to Ikyur, Ortom’s statements on the state of the nation should not be misconstrued for demeaning the office of the President. Ortom has been vocal against the leadership style of President Buhari, especially his alleged silence over the killings by suspected militias in Benue State and other parts of the country. Speaking at a brief meeting with journalists at the Benue State Governor’s Lodge in Abuja at the weekend, Ikyur said Ortom would continue to stand for the people of Benue state not minding whose ox is gored. “I want to reiterate the fact that my principal, Governor Samuel Ortom doesn’t hate President Buhari. His comments on the state of the nation and the leadership style of the president do not mean he hates him. No sane person will keep mum while his people are being killed on a daily basis. I am sure you are aware of the killings that have been going on in Logo, Guma, Agatu and other parts of Benue State by suspected herdsmen. “Do you expect the governor to keep quiet? He will continue to speak and stand for his people,” he said. Asked If his principal is eyeing the Benue North West Senatorial seat, Ikyur said, “Governor Ortom is aware of the clamour in many quarters on him to contest for Senate in 2023, but in his usual character, he is still consulting with God and will make his intention known in due course.” The CPS used the forum to parley the online media, charging them to always reach the Benue Governor’s media team, to balance their stories, assuring of open doors policy.
