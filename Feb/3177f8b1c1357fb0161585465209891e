the plant has capacity to produce 140 megawatts which is more than enough for steady power supply even to its environs. Nnaji stated this while taking Abia state  governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu on a tour of the plant in Osisioma Industrial Layout, adding that it is the largest economic project in the entire South East geopolitical zone. The chairman said at present Aba is supplied a maximum of 50 megawatts of power from the National Grid while He further explained that all the required infrastructure support for the plant expecially the 17km gas pipeline from Owaza in Ukwa West local government area of the state among others had been completed. Nnaji, who hinted that the plant would be commissioned soon, commended the governor for his role in resuscitating the contract, recounting how he traveled with him to meet with different international institutional investors. In his remarks after the tour, Ikpeazu, excited by what he saw, described the project as the “fulcrum upon which the industial development of Aba, the state, and the zone will revolve,” “Two years from today, the story of economic development in Aba will take a different turn,” he said.” “Things will never be the same again and anyone who hasn’t concluded plans to have presence here is already late.” The governor, therefore, assured the chief executive officer that the government would embark on the construction of the road leading to the plant promptly in continuation of its contributions to make the project a reality.
