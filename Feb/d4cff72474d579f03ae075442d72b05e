Sheikh Tahir died in Kaduna on Wednesday evening during a brief illness. His passage was confirmed to journalists yesterday by the deputy chief imam of Jama’a, Alhaji Muhammad Kabir D. Kassim. He said the late Imam who spent many years leading the Juma’at prayer at Kafanchan Central Mosque, was a devoted, pious Muslim and a role model. In his condolence letter, the emir of Jema’a in Kafanchan, Alhaji Muhammad Isa Muhammad II, described the death of the imam as a loss to the entire Jama’a Emirate and the people of Southern Kaduna. The condolence letter signed by the traditional council secretary, Alhaji Yakubu Isa (Dokajen Jema’a), expressed shock over the demise of the chief imam and one of the kingmakers in the emirate. He also prayed for the deceased soul to rest in eternal peace.
