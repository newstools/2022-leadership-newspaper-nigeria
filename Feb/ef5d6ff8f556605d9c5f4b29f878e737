Thirty-seven directors in the federal civil service vying for the position of permanent secretary failed their promotion examinations. However, 37 other candidates, who passed the examination, have been invited for an ICT proficiency test on Thursday, February 24, 2022 in Abuja. Office of Head of the Civil Service of the Federation said the highest score was 74 per cent, while the least score was 26 per cent. The ICT test would take place at the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) as disclosed in a circular released by the examination committee in the office of the head of civil service.
