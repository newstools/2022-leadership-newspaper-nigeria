Gunmen believed to be bandits invaded Farfaru and Kwari communities in Jibia local government area of Katsina State yesterday, shot and kidnapped scores of people mostly women and children. A credible source told LEADERSHIP Sunday that the hoodlums attacked Farfaru village around 3:pm to avenge the arrest of some of their Fulani brothers who were seized by security agents. The source said: “My home town Farfaru was set ablaze by the bandits today at about 1500 hours. Many women and children were kidnapped and livestock were rustled. This is as a result of arresting some Fulani bandits yesterday after Friday prayers.” Similarly, the attack at Kwari village also happened at about 9:30 pm where another reliable source disclosed that the bandits invaded the town on motorcycle and over 20 of them began to shoot sporadically at residents of the town. According to him, a lot of people were taken to hospital in Katsina as a result of the gunshot wounds, while the number of those killed in the attack were to be ascertained yesterday. He added that security personnel arrived the town and drove the attackers to the forest, as thousands of people left the town for Jibia for safety. Efforts to contact the state police command proved abortive at the time of filing this report.
