The protest by Mbaka’s followers was targeted at Bishop Onaga with the demonstrators insisting that the Bishop must go. But, in a statement he personally signed, Mbaka said: “my attention has been drawn to activities that took place in the Adoration ground on Sunday. I am not in any way involved in such activity. Mbaka’s Followers Stage Protest Over Ban On Adoration Ministry “We received with obedience the directive issued by my Bishop, His Excellency, Most Rev CVV Onaga on June 17, 2022. “May I, therefore, appeal to the faithful, in particular members of Adoration Ministry Enugu, Nigeria, to remain calm and United with the body of Christ in the Diocese and also refrain from any measure of violence either in action or by abusive utterances. “Those who take to attacking or insulting my dear Bishop, should desist from such. “The Bishop is the Shepherd of the Church in the Diocese and we remain his flock who in every way and at all times is expected to be respectful, obedient and willing to respond favourably to his apostolic directives. “May I also remind you that all Adoration activities have been suspended till further notice. “Adoration Ministry is ever submissive to the mother Church.
