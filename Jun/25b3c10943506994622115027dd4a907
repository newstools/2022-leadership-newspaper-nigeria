Uchemba on his Instagram account, while urging Nigerians to vote in the upcoming general elections said he would rather wait in a queue for eight hours than experience another eight years of bad governance. “The process might not be easy but remember how important your vote will be. Eight hours wait is better than eight years of pain.” He urged Nigerians to visit the nearest registration centers to get their PVCs. Meantime, Peter Okoye in a twit demanded that anyone visiting his home or office must present their PVCs before entrance. The instruction, he said, includes his management team and entourage.  “No PVC! No Visits and Travels! … We must get it right this time and vote out bad leaders,” he wrote.  The two celebrities are not the only ones in the forefront voters’ registration campaign ahead of 2023 elections. A few others have vowed to call out their colleagues who accept bribes from politicians to campaign for them.
