NYAN President, Comrade Godiya Adams in a statement issued alongside other members of the body said Dogara remains the most viable candidate to work with Tinubu to deliver dividends of democracy to Nigerians. The group said Dogara has been so loyal to the APC and has never failed in any task bestowed on him. NYAN implored the leadership of the APC to suppprt his candidature and give him all the necessary support he need to emerge as the running mate. “ Dogara performed excellently well as Speaker, he provided quality leadership then and really stabilized the house, he should be given another chance to show his capability. “He ensured the urgent passage of the Not too young to run bill and also facilitated the establishment of the North-East Development commission, NEDC which was sponsored by him,” he said.  The group further appreciated the leadership of Northern Governors forum for zoning the Vice presidential candidate to North-East.
