Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has directed the state’s attorney-general and commissioner for justice, Prof. Zaccheaus Adangor, to begin the prosecution of former transportation minister, Rotimi Amaechi, over alleged fraudulent sale of state assets and diversion of $50m. He gave the directive at the Government House in Port Harcourt while augurating three new commissioners yesterday. Wike named others to be included the state APC governorship candidate, Tonye Cole and his company, Sahara Energy. He said there was need for people of the state and other people to know what happened to the $50 million that disappeared from state’s account. “Attorney General, you’re at a critical period where people want to know what the State is going to do with the Judiciary Panel of Inquiry after the Supreme Court judgement on it. Luckily, you came at the right time when we have preferred criminal charges against the former governor (Amaechi), Sahara Energy, Tonye Cole and the rest of them. “So, you are coming at the right time to take over the matter and to make sure it is prosecuted diligently. I don’t want to hear excuses. Let the people see what happened to our money. The world will see how $50 million from our account was moved to a company without nothing to show whether there was a business,” the governor said. He also directed the attorney general to send a protest letter to the EFCC following the harassment of Rivers PDP governorship candidate, Siminalaye Fubara.
