The secretary of the defunct Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator James Akpanudoedehe, has resigned his membership of the party, few hours before the presidential primary election slated for Tuesday. Akpanudoedehe disclosed this in a letter of resignation dated June 4, 2022 and addressed to the APC chairman of his Offot Ward 6, Uyo in Akwa Ibom State. “I write to notify you of my resignation from the All Progressives Congress (APC), forthwith.  “Henceforth, I cease to be a member of the APC in my ward (ward 6 in Uyo LGA) or anywhere for that matter. I hereby relinquish all rights which inured to me as a member of the APC, member of the National Advisory Council and member of the National Caucus of the APC. “This decision to part ways with the APC is a tough one but leadership entails adherence to the wishes of the vast majority of associates, allies and supporters who have shown fidelity over time and have now witnessed the obduracy of the APC in handling the Candidates Selection processes in Akwa Ibom State. “Our greater goal of providing service to the people of our dear state remains sacrosanct,” he wrote.
