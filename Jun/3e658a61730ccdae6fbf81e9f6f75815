Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), Prof. Itse Sagay (SAN), has warned the leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). against fielding a northern presidential candidate as this may affect the party’s chances in the 2023 general elections.  He said no northerner should participate in the primary exercise of the APC and that the primary should be thrown open to all Southern aspirants and the winner should fly the party’s flag.  Sagay, who was reacting to reports that the APC National chairman, Abdullahi Adamu has announced Senate President, Ahmad Lawan as the APC’s consensus candidate, urged Lawan to be careful so as not to fall into Adamu’s trap.  He said, “My view is that let the contest be thrown open. Let there be a free, fair election and whoever wins will be the candidate. No candidate of Northern origin should participate in the primary.  “Clearly, the APC without putting it in writing took the decision that a northerner, particularly our current president should be the first person to be sponsored by the party and it is therefore not just logical but natural and fair that on this occasion after eight years, a Southerner should be fielded.  “For another northerner to come out again may have very devastating consequences on the future of APC.”
