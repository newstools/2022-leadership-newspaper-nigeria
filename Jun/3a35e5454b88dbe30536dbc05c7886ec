The federal ministry of agriculture and rural development on Thursday said it would import 10,000 units of tractors and 50,000 units of assorted implements from Brazil and  equipment for assembly in Nigeria in the bid to drive the mechanised farming policy and improve food production. The initiative will also cover 142 turnkey factories for agro-processing as well  as training of the project beneficiaries for over a period of five years. This development was disclosed in a statement by the ministry’s assistant director of information, Salamatu  Jibaniya in Abuja. Jibaniya stated that the minister of agriculture and rural development, Dr Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar said that the federal government will achieve the feat through partnership with the Brazilian government which would be responsible for the supply of the equipments. Dr Abubakar who gave this indication at the opening ceremony of Africa’s agricultural machines and equipment technology expo on industrialising Africa’s agriculture through technology and innovation in Abuja recently, also said that the purpose of the expo was to expose African farmers to cost- effective farm machines, new farming technologies and increase foreign direct investments. He said, “The partnership with Brazilian counterparts would ensure the provision of 10,000 units of tractors,50,000 units of assorted implements and equipment for assembly in Nigeria, 142 turnkey factories for agro processing as well  as training of the project beneficiaries for over a period of five years. The quest for food self- sufficiency cannot be achieved using the old method of rudimentary tools therefore  farmers are urged to grab the new technologies and innovations in order to do exploits in farm practices”.
