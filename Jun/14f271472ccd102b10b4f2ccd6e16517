US-based Nigerian musician and vocal Powerhouse Jemiriye, celebrated her birthday on Friday May 27th, 2022 and it was a momentous felicitation for her. The musician who recently came back from her long week trip to Senegal, had a handful of experiences and performances notably her meeting a young boy named Faye in need of  education sponsorship and this formed her birthday wish. In her post on her social media handle, she asked her fans to support her in raising funds for the education of the young boy who comes from a very humble background. She said “Who remembers this cute boy that photo bombed my paparazzi moment on the street of Dakar recently? Well his name is Faye. Since our first encounter, I’ve not been able to get him off my mind. “So after my one week residency with Afrik’Consult at the Grand Théâtre Doudou Ndiaye Rose in Dakar Senegal, I went out to look for my young friend Faye for days. I was so frustrated, I spoke with Mr Latsouk Ndiaye (director of Afrik’Consult) that I needed his help to find Faye, I needed help with French or Wollof interpretation for a smooth communication, and he gladly obliged. “After days of searching, we found Faye, and we went out, did some shopping together, played, ate and had a heart to heart conversation with Faye’s mum, a beautiful strong African woman. “I’ll love to dedicate my birthday this year to raise funds to help my friend Faye go to school next year through my non-profit organization, EWA Global initiative. (A foundation dedicated to empowering black Women and children). Let’s get Faye off the street, he’s a very promising and intelligent young man”. The singer who’s set to release a body of work, an E.P, was the first Nigerian artiste to win the prestigious Outstanding International Artist, at the AD King Foundation’s Annual Youth Empowerment Award Gala held last year in Atlanta Georgia.
