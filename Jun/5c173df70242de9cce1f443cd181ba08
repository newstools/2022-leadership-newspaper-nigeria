Urging Nigerians to support former minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, national coordinator of the group, Comrade Evans City, said it is becoming clearer every day that some people’s interest is to divide the party across tribal lines. In a statement issued yesterday, G-37 said this set of persons have been embarking on a meaningless political campaign of calumny against the party’s intention to conduct free, fair and transparent primaries to produce a presidential candidate and those for other elective positions. The group urged the national leadership of APC to be more focused, even as it commended the national chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, for his unbiased efforts in ensuring a level playing ground for aspirants aspiring for various positions on the platform of the party. The group lauded Amaechi for visiting the delegates in all the 36 states and FCT within a short time frame. The support group assured the delegates that Amaechi’s presidency would bring succour to Nigerians as he will consolidate on the achievements of the present administration.
