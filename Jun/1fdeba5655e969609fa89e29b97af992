The main objectives of AIO are the development of a healthy insurance and reinsurance industry and the promotion of inter-African co-operation, he said. Noting that AIO is 50 years old and that within its 50 years of existence, the headquarters of the AIO has been in Cameroon for 38 years, he noted that, the theme of the association’s anniversary celebration is; ‘AIO At 50: A Call For African Insurance Renaissance.’ Through a symposium, he said, some seasoned African insurance professionals will through this theme examine the state of insurance in Africa in the past fifty years and make predictions on how to better the industry on the continent in future.  To him, “through this reflection, we hope to address serious issues like Africa’s low insurance penetration rate, bringing insurance services closer to our populations and at more affordable costs lifting insurance to the level of a solution to problems rather than a counter for the sale of insurance products only.”
