TOP, at its stakeholders meeting held on Thursday at Oranmiyan House, Osogbo, denounced the rumour making the rounds that the caucus is forging a working relationship with different parties ahead of the July 16governorship election.
The group disowned any individual or group using its name or that of its Patron, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, to negotiate, noting that the caucus will not stoop low to engage in contractual politics. Chairman of the caucus, Rev. Lowo Adebiyi, in a press statement issued in Osogbo on Thursday, said anybody who is holding discussions with or negotiating with other political parties is doing it at his own risk. Adebiyi reiterated TOP’s focus of reclaiming the party from the current cesspool of abyss.
He urged members of the group all over the state to remain steadfast and resilient in the pursuit of the noble goal. The group congratulated Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his emergence as the APC presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections, just as he felicitated with the party and its national executives for the success of the special convention.
