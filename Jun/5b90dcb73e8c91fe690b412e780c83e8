Super Eagles forward Umar Sadiq has reiterated his desire to stay with LaLiga new boys, Almeria next season. The 25-year-old played a prominent role as Almeria gained promotion from the Spanish Segunda Division club in the 2021/22 season. Sadiq scored 18 goals and provided 12 assists in 36 league appearances for Rubi’s side. The Nigerian international has been linked with a move away from the club, but he has expressed his desire to remain at the club beyond this summer. “Playing in the First Division is a dream, and I want to do it with Almería,” the former Partizan forward told the media, as per AS “It is a place where I have found the affection and trust of the coach. I have very tempting offers, but I will stay 100% in Almería.” Sadiq is currently with Nigeria for their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying fixture against Sao Tome and Principe.
