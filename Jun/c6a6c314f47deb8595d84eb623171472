Khafi in an Instagram post expressed grief that her brother’s killers are still at large, and that incidences as the Owo Massacre and the needless death of young black boys triggers her grief anew. “Today marked two years since my brother Alex was murdered in cold blood on the streets of London. It feels so wrong to commemorate this kind of anniversary; wedding, birthdays etc. are things that should be celebrated and remembered, not a day of death. But two years on and till his murderers have not been found. This is not okay. It hurts me every day, and it is not getting any easier. I just find better ways to suppress my grief as time goes on, but every time it arises, it is like a dagger to my chest afresh. “It has made me so sensitive to any news of death, especially shootings like those in Owo, Uvalde, and particularly news of young black boys dying needlessly. They trigger so much for me. “I was dreading today. And if I had it my way, I would have buried my head in the sand and pretended this isn’t my reality. I had three brothers, and now I only have two. And the people responsible are still walking the streets. It makes me so angry. “But my brother @kabiz_k wrote this song (full song in my bio) and it expresses so much of how I feel. I couldn’t not share it. Please listen in memory of my brother Alex and all the fallen. Their deaths will not be in vain. And if you have any information on Alex’s death, it is not too late to speak up,” concluded Khafi. 20-year-old Alexander Kareem-Ekpata was shot dead on his way home after a visit to a convenience store in Shepherd’s Bush, West London, on June 8, 2020. The lad who was set to study Computer Science at the University in September 2020, was buried on July 29.  Seven persons were arrested in connection to his on August of the same year. But according to his sister his killers are yet to be found.
