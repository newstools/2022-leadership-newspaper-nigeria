 Lawan who came 4th in the presidential primary of the governing party, next to former Transportation minister, Rotimi Amaechi, and Vice President Yemi, Osinbajo had no choice than to fall back to his bid to remain in the Red Chamber. There had been insinuations that Machina has relinquished his candidature to the Senate president after losing his presidential bid under the platform of the party last week. But his spokesman, Hussaini Mohammed Isa, stated yesterday that Machina has not and will not step down for anybody.  Isa noted that Machina did not participate in the primary election for him to step down for anyone but to accomplish the mandate given to him by the people of the zone. “I want to assure you that Hon Bashir Sheriff Machina did not step down and will not step down for anybody including the one you mentioned, the senate President Ahmed Ibrahim Lawan. Machina contested in the election and won. Why will he step down,” Isa queried. He described rumours of his principal relinquishing his candidature as mere speculations orchestrated to create confusion among the supporters of the candidate. He urged people in the senatorial district, especially Machina’s supporters to remain calm and focus assuring that “my boss will not step down for anybody.”
