Speaking after the closed-door meeting, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, announced that the Senate delegation will be leaving the country by Friday for the UK. “The Senate delegation will leave the country in two days,” Lawan said while asking relevant government agencies to ensure that they give the Senate Committee the necessary support that will ensure that it achieve success in its assignment. “All federal government agencies should ensure that justice is done in the Ekweremadu’s case. The ministry of Foreign Affairs should ensure they provide every service that is required for the traveling and the engagement of our committee,” Lawan added. LEADERSHIP reports that the Nigeria High Commissioner to UK, Sarafadeen Ishola, has been doing alot to ensure Ekweremadu and his wife get a fair deal in the allegation including providing legal representation for the couple.
