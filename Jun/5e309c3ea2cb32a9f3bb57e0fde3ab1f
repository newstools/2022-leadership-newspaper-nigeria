Speaker of Lagos State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, has urged Nigerians to play active roles in order to achieve the quest to make the country greater. He said this in a statement to commemorate Nigeria’s Democracy Day which coincides with 29th anniversary of the June 12, 1993 elections claimed to have been won by late Chief Moshood Abiola. According to the Speaker, Nigeria had, since 1999, experienced what could best be described as the teething stage of its democratic journey with the need for unity taking the centre-stage of public discourse. “However, it is now very glaring that we are on the threshold of history with the forthcoming general elections that is now heralded by the smooth convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the emergence of our flagbearer, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “The new story that we all anticipate, envisage and dream about for our country is achievable and right before us. Our hopes are rekindled. All that is required is our collectively resolve to be part of the ship of progress,” Obasa said. While thanking Nigerian leaders, the civil society and citizens who joined in the struggle for the emancipation of the country from the military, Obasa added: “We remain steadfast in our resolve to make our democracy truly work for us all as Nigerians.
