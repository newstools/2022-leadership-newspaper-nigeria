 The elated lawmaker, who is also the Chairman Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and Other Financial Institutions made this known on his verified twitter account on Wednesday. The Kaduna governorship candidate stated that with Asiwaju’s victory, the APC was poised to deliver a telling blow to the PDP and other parties in the 2023 presidential elections. Describing Tinubu as “leading politician and master political strategist, achiever and veteran of many political battles”, Sani also assured that “Asiwaju has all it takes to lead us to victory and build on the legacy of our dear President Muhammadu Buhari”. He also expressed satisfaction over the efforts of the National Working Committee of the APC and the governors for “working assiduously to deliver an excellent Special Convention.” Turning to the role the president played in the primary election, Sani commended Buhari for “providing a level playing ground which made it possible for us to have a rancour free convention.” “Let us get down to work. We must not rest on our oars until victory is certain,” Sani said while congratulating Tinubu on his victory.
