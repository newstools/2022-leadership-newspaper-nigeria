 Egbe said all that the turf needs is the touch of an expert who understands the pyrotechnics of what a modern stadium turf should look like.
According to him, whatever amount of money pumped into the turf would go down the drain if it is not handled by a thoroughbred professional groundsman. “This is my sector and I know what I am talking about. Nigerians were not happy with what they saw of the pitch when we played Sierra Leone. It is sad that the pitch is that way after all the money pumped into it by Dangote. “I am ready to help as a patriotic Nigerian and I have always said my company Monimichelle is ready to partner both the states and federal government to eradicate bad pitches in the country. “The pitches we have done in the country are there for people to see. From Aba, to Lagos, Katsina, Makurdi, Awka, Yenagoa and Remo what we have done there and our job speaks for us. I don’t compromise quality and as a nation, we should have the best of pitches in Abuja and Lagos,” Egbe said.
Egbe said Sports Minister Sunday Dare has done well by getting Dangote and Baba Ijebu to renovate the stadiums in Lagos and Abuja but was quick to add that he (Dare) must move now to ensure that these business moguls are impressed with the job done.
