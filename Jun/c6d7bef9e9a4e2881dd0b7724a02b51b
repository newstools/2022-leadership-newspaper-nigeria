The inspector-general of police (IGP) Usman Baba has approved the establishment of Electoral Offences Desk at the Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID), Force headquarters, Abuja. The IGP also approved the commissioner of police, FCID, as the desk officer. The IGP has equally approved its establishment at state commands across the nation with the assistant commissioners of police in charge of the criminal investigation departments as state desk officers. Force spokesperson, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said the mandate of the electoral offences desk officers includes the collation and investigation of all electoral offences/complaints from members of the public or any quarters, with a view to determining culpability in line with the amended Electoral Act 2022, and proffering charges before courts of competent jurisdiction for necessary legal action. The IGP tasked the desk to commence its activities immediately with some isolated cases recorded during the pre-election activities such as screening, conventions, primaries, among others.
