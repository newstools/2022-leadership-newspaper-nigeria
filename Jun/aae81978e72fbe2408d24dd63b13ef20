Family, friends and church members wept profusely yesterday when the Catholic Archdiocese of Kaduna performed the funeral rites without the corpse of slain Rev Fr Joseph Bako Aketeh. The cleric was kidnapped by terrorists who later killed him while in their captivity. The funeral rite was performed at St. John’s Catholic church Kudenda, Kaduna where he was kidnapped by terrorists on March 8th, 2022. It would be recalled that the late Fr Bako was kidnapped at his residence at St John’s Catholic Church Kudenda where he served as a parish priest alongside his brother Sunday Bako. The Catholic Archdiocese of Kaduna confirmed his death and that of his brother through its chancellor. During his homily, the Catholic Archbishop of Kaduna, Most Rev Matthew Man-Oso Ndagoso said, “ This is the first time I am presiding over a funeral mass without the corpse, we hope that one day we would be able to see even if it is his bones.” The archbishop further said, “Nigerians are worn out due to weeping, our eyes could no longer produce tears. Bandits are terrorising with impunity. Does our government really care about our pains? Something is happening, they have failed us. “Nigeria is a country where citizens are treated unequally because of religion and ethnicity. Vices has become a value in our country.” The archbishop advised the federal government to use Nigeria resources to recruit young men who are willing to fight insecurity in order to defend the country. Also speaking, the Catholic Bishop of Kano, Most Rev John Nyring urged Nigerians to get their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) in order to elect leaders that will secure their lives and property. Bishop Nyring also charged parents to give their children good upbringing in order to have less criminals in the society.
