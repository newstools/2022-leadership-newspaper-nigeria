All eligible voters should quickly go and register and obtain their permanent voter cards, ensure they vote and their votes count in the overall result as power belongs to the people. This is the only way to restore the nation’s unity, greatness, prosperity and dignity in the comity of nations. We are all in it together to usher in a New Nigeria citizens will be proud of,” the statement added.
