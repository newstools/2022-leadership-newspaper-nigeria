 The three-man ad hoc delegates for the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) primary elections in Ebonyi State yesterday disassociated themselves from the rescheduled June 4 and 5 primaries in the state. Addressing journalists in Abakaliki, the delegates described the ongoing repeat primary elections as a sham, noting that they would neither be part of nor participate in it. It would be recalled that the party had on May 28 and 29 elected candidates for various positions in the state ahead of the 2023 polls. One of the delegates, Mr Okorie-Chukwumaobi Okorie described the repeat primaries as unconstitutional. Meanwhile, the PDP Ebonyi State chairman, Hon Tochukwu Okorie, yesterday said that notice of election was given to security agencies adding that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) refused a letter sent to them for the conduct of the primaries.   “What the law says concerning INEC is that, political parties shall notify the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of any upcoming election, we have complied with that, the onus of monitoring or observing elections of political parties lies squarely on the commission”.  “It is not the role of the political party to go and drag INEC or its officials from their homes to come and observe elections”.
