A pan-African non-governmental organisation, Madiba Foundation for Good Governance, has launched a project aimed at reigniting active citizenship and fresh zest amongst Nigeria’s literate youth and grassroots communities for civic participation. Tagged: “Organising for a New Nigeria (ONN),’ the project would use the tools of media, technology, and grassroots organizing to build a movement that engages youth in Nigeria’s democratic processes from elections to governance, according to a statement by the group. The group said it would be adopting a ‘MAIN’ model to meet its goals and objectives. The model comprises the mobilisation of young people using digital technology; advocacy to galvanise public support; intervention through the mobilisation of youth energy and resources to address pressing governance issues; and nurturing platforms to groom an army of young people to make meaningful contributions to Nigeria’s development. The group’s chief operating officer, Frederick Adetiba, said with the current state of affairs in the country, there are two options available to citizens: leave the country or stay back and fix it. “Madiba Foundation is creating a platform that would give passionate and patriotic Nigerians, especially young people, an opportunity to stay back and fix the country,” Adetiba said.
