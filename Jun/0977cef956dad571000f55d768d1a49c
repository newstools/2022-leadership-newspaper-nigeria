T he Nigerian capital market analysts expect cautious trading on the stock market as possibility of continued profit-taking activities cannot be ruled out this week. They noted that, “investors and traders across the globe are worried over the rising inflation and impending global economic recession, even as all eyes are on the world and even domestic economic data, while selling sentiments continue across some sectors and funds flow into fixed income instruments from risk-averse investors due to the increase in interest rate and the May inflation rate which soared to 17.71 per cent, an 11-month peak since June 2021, according to National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).” Analysts’ projections Analysts at Cordros Securities Limited said: “with the significant moderation in the prices of bellwether stocks this week, we expect savvy investors to take advantage of this and make a re-entry into stocks with sound fundamentals and attractive dividend yields. “However, we do not rule out the possibility of continued profit-taking activities. As a result, we think the local bourse will likely exhibit a choppy pattern. Therefore, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks.” In the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited expected to see mixed reactions to the daily change of the local bourse. “Meanwhile, with the expectations of Q2 numbers coming in over the next few weeks we continue to maintain positive sentiments in the market although profit-taking will likely set in as prices rise. Investors are advised to trade on companies’ stocks with good fundamentals and a positive outlook so as to avoid falling into the bear trap,” they said. While GTI Securities Limited stressed that, “the Nigerian equity market closed last week negative on a four consecutive day’s bearish trend, as investors continue to digest the impact of Fed’s decision on the economy. We expect cautious trading and profit taking to continue in the domestic market.” Last Week’s Trading Activities The local bourse was not immune to the rout in global equities, as profit-taking activities dominated trading last week.
