Ogbonna spoke in an exclusive interview with LEADERSHIP in Umuahia, the Abia State capital after securing the party’s ticket for the election, saying he is confident of landslide victory.
“Since 1999 nobody from my clan, Ohuhu, in Umuahia North local government area of the constituency has ever occupied the seat, And this is the time to balance the equation for equity sake,” he said.
He maintained that he is not intimidated by the connections and political profiles of his opponents, adding that his battle with the strongest among them will be like the fight between Goliath and David. Ogbonna said if elected into the office, he would bring a drastic turn-around in the fortunes of the constituency by attracting both democracy dividends and human capital development.
“We must change the face of the constituency as the host of the state capital. We must work in concert with each other to give the constituency a befitting look. We can’t allow the rot continue.”
