 The United Nations SDGs are anchored on transforming lives through 5 powerful drivers, which includes; People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership, in a bid to combat humanity’s greatest challenges of poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace and justice.  Speaking on this development, the president, UNAN, Mrs Joan Agha, said, her association will aid this blueprint to achieve a better and sustainable future for all.
She also enjoined all and sundry to take action with social responsibility for one another starting with disadvantaged areas and people in Lagos state.  According to her, “we are already in the 7th year of this Masterplan since UN declared the 17 SDGs in 2015. Our role therefore is to solicit support from partners, collaborators and benefactors in improving lives through SDG 1, 2, 6 and 8 which state thus: No Poverty, No Hunger, Clean Water and Sanitation, Decent Work and Economic Growth. To this end, she called on relevant stakeholders to usher in a new era of co-operation and prosperity with the inauguration of the key drivers of this project which event will benefit Lagos State citizens as inaugural beneficiaries.

It is up to us all to raise our standards of living for ourselves and our fellow human beings”  UNAN was established in 1959 by Professor Babatunde Fafunwa, one of Nigeria’s foremost educationists.
