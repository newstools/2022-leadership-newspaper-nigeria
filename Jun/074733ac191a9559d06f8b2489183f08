 Besides, several houses, among other properties, were burnt in the inferno, as men of the state fire service and the police were deployed to the area.
LEADERSHIP Friday gathered that the incident happened around 5am yesterday, when the tanker lost control and ran into a fuel station close to the veterinary school. However, emergency officials, including firefighters from the Plateau State Fire Service, were deployed at the scene to put out the fire and salvage other properties.
Some shops around Gada Biyu Park were also affected by the fire, which lasted for hours. Attempts by residents to put out the inferno were unsuccessful as the fire rages beyond control.  A lifeless body was later discovered in a gutter with speculation that it could be the driver of the tanker, while the conductor of the vehicle suffered severe burns and was said to be receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital.
The police public relation officer (PPRO) Plateau State command, ASP Alfred Alago confirmed the incident but said investigation is ongoing to unravel the cause of the inferno.
