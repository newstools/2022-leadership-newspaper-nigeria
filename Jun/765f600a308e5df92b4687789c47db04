The candidate of Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) for Kogi Central Senatorial election Abdulkadir Tajudden has promised to prioritize the revitalization of Ajaokuta Steel Company to generate jobs for the teeming unemployed youths in the country. Tajudeen who picked the ticket of PRP last Saturday through affirmation gave the charge while speaking with newsmen in Lokoja, Kogi State yesterday. According to him, the Ajaokuta Steel Company which was abandoned by successive administration will be his focus if given the mandate to represent the people at the red chamber of the national assembly. “We all know the potential which abound in Ajaokuta Steel Company. Being an integrated steel industry, it is capable of creating enormous jobs and as well generate revenue for the government especially now that crude oil can no longer sustain government at all levels. “Therefore, my major focus will be how I can move and sponsor bills for the resuscitation of the ailing industry for the benefit of my constituency and Nigerians generally. “That is why I am appealing to the electorate to go out and obtain their Permanent Voter’s Card and those who have reached voting age and are yet to register should do that on time so that they can vote for our party the PRP during the 2023 election,” he said Speaking on the chances of PRP, the flag bearer said “whenever I hear big political parties most often than not, the names do not shake me. There is no political party that is small but what matters most is the calibre of people in the party. “Our party PRP is for victory and we must work assiduously to ensure that the party win elections in Kogi State,” he said.
