 ASUU’s chairman, Universities, University of Ibadan branch, Professor Ayoola Akinwole, in the June 12 message said, “it is a strategy of handing over the country to those individuals who have looted the country in the past. According to him, if this practice goes unchallenged, Nigerians are in for not just another regime of poor governance but that of extreme corruption and looting”. The ASUU boss stated that it would take a Nigerian Professor who earns N416, 000 per month but saves 20 per cent of his salary over 100 years to be able to purchase the presidential nomination form of the ruling party and over 40years to buy the form of the main opposition party.
Akinwole stated that the 23 years of return of democracy had been characterised by “leadership of empty promises and dashed hopes. “Given the prevailing level of corruption and loss of hope in the future, political leaders in Nigeria have shown lack of willingness and capacity and the capacity to protect lives and properties and they have successfully failed in promoting productive activities that can boost the Nigerian economy.”
He advised that nothing would change except the country allows equitable distribution of wealth and access to quality education, health and security. “Until we improve our economic situation democracy will not prosper. The only antidote to this is to have a large percentage of the middle class sufficient to support democracy. Build public institutions instead of giving money to people. No amount of money freely given will ever eradicate poverty in Nigeria”, he said.  ASUU urged the ruling elites “to shun corruption, greed and primitive accumulation as well as desist from fanning embers and cinders of disunity and violence”.  Akinwole advised governments at all levels to provide basic social infrastructure as well as provide employment opportunities in order to reduce poverty and crime.
