 Kwankwaso, a former chieftain of both the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) recently clinched the presidential ticket of the NNPP, which had been in existence for over 20 years but has remained relatively unpopular compared to the two other frontline parties; the PDP and APC. Speaking with journalists in Lagos, the clergyman said though he had not met Kwankwaso for the first time before the revelation, God revealed to him he would emerge the nation’s next president. He also said that God has destined the NNPP flagbearer to address many of the myriads of challenges bedevilling the country comprising insecurity, dwindling economic fortunes, worsening disunity and religious intolerance among the citizens, adding that he would also spearhead the attainment of fiscal federalism being clamoured for by many Nigerians.  “Before this revelation, I had neither met nor known this man called Kwankwaso. The first time God gave me this revelation was in 2014 when he (Kwankwaso) contested the presidential ticket of the APC with President Muhammadu Buhari and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar in which Buhari emerged the party’s flagbearer”, he said.
