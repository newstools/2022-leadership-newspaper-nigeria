 Last week, Medvedev was in action at the Libema Open, where he marched to his second tour-level final on grass at the ATP 250 event. Medvedev’s rise comes after Novak Djokovic failed to defend his crown at the French Open. Medvedev is unable to compete at this year’s Wimbledon as Russian and Belarusian players have been banned following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ranking points, however, will not be awarded. For the first time in 19 years, none of the ‘Big Three’ – Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer – occupy the first two spots.
Rafael Nadal remains at the 4th spot despite losing 1000 points gained from last year’s French Open while Djokovic has dropped 2000 points from his winning run at Roland Garros last year.
