 Alkali condemned a statement credited to APC deputy national publicity secretary  Yakubu Ajaka  calling on Sen Rabiu Kwankwaso to  return to APC because he has a better chance of becoming president on the party’s platform in the future.  However, Alkali in a statement signed yesterday in Abuja said such thoughts sounded like that of a drowning man looking for support.  He said if Ajaka should study the mood of the nation he would have noticed the current exodus of APC members and indeed those from other parties into NNPP.  According to Alkali, “I won’t be surprised if Ajaka knocks on our doors in coming days to give him accommodation.”  He stated that Nigerians have since expressed their dissatisfaction with the APC and are looking for a credible alternative which they find in NNPP.  He added that the APC chieftain is living in the past and should wake up to current realities.
