The president, Peoples Movement for a New Nigeria (PMNN), Alhaji Yahaya Ndu, has called for the emergence of a South Easterner as the next president of Nigeria. Ndu, who is also the director, Institute for African Renaissance Studies and Realization at the Gregory University, Uturu, said there shouldn’t be debate on where the presidency should go in 2023, adding that the South East has been marginalised. The Enugu State indigene while giving an analysis of regions that have ruled the country during a press conference in Abuja, said;  “The South East has ruled one time totaling 0.5 year or 1%. based on average of 10.71 years for each of the six regions, North West,  North Central and South West are overfed; South South and North East are moderately fed, while the South East  is grossly underfed and marginalised. They should get the next slot. “If other regions have managed Nigeria for 99% of our existence, Nigeria is still beset with poverty, corruption, weak economy, nepotism and terrorism, it is time to try the South East. “Fortunately, the South East has an abundance of leadership talents. For true Muslims there should be no debate or contention as to where the president of Nigeria should come from in 2023. It should by all standards be from the South East.”
