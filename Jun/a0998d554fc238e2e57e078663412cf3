Director General (DG), Tinubu Presidential Campaign Forum, Omobola Bolu Omoleme, has urged presidential aspirants to run issue-based campaigns during the election. She stated this while congratulating Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC); Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) and Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) for emerging as presidential candidates of their parties. Omoleme, in a statement, said their emergence as flag bearers of their political parties was never a coincidence, pointing out that their humanitarian leadership precedence did earn them the victory but insisted that running an issue based campaign will help in the electoral integrity. She also charged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to increase PVC registration centres to avail citizens the opportunity to register and participate in the 2023 general election. “Let me call on the incumbent government to create a political ambiance that would generate a leveled playing ground for all candidates to compete equally ahead of the general election,” Omoleme said while cautioning the candidates to shun hate campaigns against each other and strictly align with their parties manifestos. Omoleme also called on the youths not to allow themselves to be used for political thuggery, bailout snatching, and other electoral vices. She said such an act will not take the country anywhere but rather, will affect the electoral credibility and breed bad leadership in the long run.
