 The properties which according to the medium are mostly in Kano, his home state, are said to be worth billions of naira, significantly more than his monthly salary as a public officer. Part of the assets is the Gezawa Commodity Market in Kano State.
Also, an ultra-modern mall located in Kano State, is said by sources at the EFCC to be worth more than N700 million. From the pictures obtained, the mall is built with bricks and sited on a large expanse of land.
However, while the major exterior works have been perfected, work is still ongoing inside with facilities like elevators and escalators being installed.  The accountant-general had in 2021 launched Gezawa Commodity Market and Exchange Limited which he had openly admitted to owning. Mr Idris reportedly made the remarks when he met with a delegation of the Kano Concerned Citizens Initiative led by its then chairman, the late Bashir Tofa. The enclosed market is made up of over 20 blocks of shops painted yellow and a spacious parking space. The space is occupied by fleets of pick-up vans. Premium Times however says it cannot independently ascertain if the new vehicles belong to the suspended official. Mr Idris is being investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over allegations of corruption involving over N80 billion in alleged looted public funds.
The suspended AGF, although released after spending nights in the EFCC custody, is also facing allegations of criminal conspiracy. Sources said the EFCC had for some time now been investigating a case of diversion of at least N80 billion in public funds which were allegedly laundered through some bogus contracts.  The companies used in laundering the funds have allegedly been linked to family members and associates of the suspended accountant-general, investigators said. The finance minister, Zainab Ahmed, suspended the accountant-general without pay on May 18, following his arrest and interrogation over corruption allegations.
