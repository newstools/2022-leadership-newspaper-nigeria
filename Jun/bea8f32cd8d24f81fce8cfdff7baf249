A non-government organisation (NGO), Obiianuju-Nnenna Media Foundation, has organised a digital literacy training program for FCT women to enable them to understand what they can achieve with their hand-held devices. The event which took place recently in Karu was created to help educate the participants to improve their digital experience through insight into digital technology and its possible future. The NGO founder, Obianuju Asika, said the foundation has always been passionate about impacting the lives of women positively. Asika said, “The feedback from the digital literacy program was phenomenal as most of the women had no prior understanding of the importance of the digital lifestyle. They were excited about the training and couldn’t wait for more training and to expand the knowledge they got to their immediate circle. She said the foundation, formerly known as Obiianuju Media Limited, recently expanded its objectives to include programmes for the following female gender category: The girl-child, teens and young ladies, and the adult woman. The training kits were provided by Intel and also donations from Nigerians.
