The officiating cleric for the wedding, Sheik Abdullahi Bala Kau in his sermon told the couple that one of the aims of marriage is to strengthen kinship with friends and families. He urged the woman to be submissive and loyal to her husband, while the husband respects the wife. Kau asked the couple to emulate prophet Muhammad who gave out his daughters to his disciples and him marrying daughters of disciples. “Prophet (SAW) gave out his daughter to Ali and two of his daughters to Usman. He also married the daughters of Abubakar and Umar. This is to further tighten the existing relationships between him and his close associates.” Sokoto State governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, Senate President, Ahmad Lawal, former Imo State Governor, Senator Rochas Okorocha and Senator Bukola Saraki.
