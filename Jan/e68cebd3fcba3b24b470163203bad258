First of all, my work is all about passion. It is a lifestyle which I have been into for so many years. I also enjoy myself while working. Secondly, I will say my customers, those who patronise our services. They become family and we look forward to serving them better. This is followed very closely by our employees. They are amazing people who bring something different to each day. What I don’t like most is the late nights, it’s scary at times. It’s not easy going back home at night. We will have to wait for all customers to leave before we close. Aside that we have been blessed to see a very rapid growth, it also put a strain on everyone as we worked quickly to grow faster than anticipated. Though, the challenges in this business are general. Most times setting up an event, it’s not easy. It’s a difficult task and also getting help from brands is not easy too but most times they always come through. Honestly, I think that the decision taken by our governor is for the best interest of the people. Although, the areas banned does not affect my business because my office address is located at Stadium Road in Port Harcourt not in GRA or Abacha Road area of the state. We run a wine house and lounge not a club. I wish I had opened up my business inside Victoria Island, Lagos before starting in Port Harcourt. However, before the end of the year we hope to have Wine House Lagos and Abuja branch. A cheerful person makes things glow, so I look out for a cheerful person and those who don’t get angry easily. I look out for professionals who know how to run the nightlife business as well. We have a staff WhatsApp group where everything is being discussed and all updates are given accordingly. Most customers read everything about our business on social media page. They do research online most of the times.
