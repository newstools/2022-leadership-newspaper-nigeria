What is your view on government efforts to enhance growth in the property and real estate business in Nigeria?  One of the ways government affirms its hold on real estate industry is through policies they put in place to guide the industry. One major thing government needs to do is to create more favourable policies that make it easier and safer for Nigerians at home or in the diaspora to invest in Lands and properties within the country. Creating a better credit system would also help people track their wealth or debt levels and help them make better and more informed investment decisions.
