Abayomi disclosed that bed capacity utilisation has dropped to two per cent while fatality rate stands at 0.71 per cent. He however urged Lagosians to get vaccinated, to enable the state achieve herd immunity and to strictly follow non pharmaceutical measures like frequent hand washing, wearing of nose mask and social distancing etc. He said, “We don’t want people to get sick and die as a result of the virus. If you contract the COVID-19 virus, the vaccine prevents you from getting critically ill to dying from the virus. We have started giving out the booster dose. I will advise residents living in Lagos to go to any of the vaccination sites to get their jab.”
