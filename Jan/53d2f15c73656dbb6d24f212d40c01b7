According to the formal invite sent out by the organisers, the event will take place at the Emir’s Palace in Daura, headquarters of Katsina North senatorial district at 12.30pm on the D-Day. The title, ‘Dan Amanar Daura’ to be conferred on the former Rivers State governor, literally means ‘The Confidant of Daura’.  LEADERSHIP recall that the Federal Government through Amaechi’s Transportation Ministry, established the first-ever University of Transportation in Daura, the hometown of President Muhammadu Buhari.
