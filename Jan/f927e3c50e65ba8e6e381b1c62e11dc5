Mrs Ahmed made the remarks at the public presentation of the 2022 Appropriation Act. The $3.4bn Rapid Credit Facility was obtained by the Federal Government from the IMF in 2020 during the period when the Corona virus pandemic led to a shutdown of the Nigerian economy. The IMF facility was collected by the federal government during the peak of Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. IMF used the instrument as a concessional financial assistance to countries that were facing urgent financial need.
