A serene environment with good music, good food, good staff and a wonderful kitchen crew. Nkoyo does not disappoint when it comes to tailor-made food for its customers. Immediately you sit, you are offered chips which would serve as an appetizer while the main course is prepared. I am partial to the chips, so I usually ask for more. Courteous staff makes the meal taste better, making the wait worth it.
