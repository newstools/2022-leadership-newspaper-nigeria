Frontline governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State, Senator Ademola Adeleke, has restated his commitment to rescue Osun from what he called bad governance despite campaign of calumny from certain quarters. Adeleke made the disclosure in response to the report of the PDP Appeal Screening Panel which again cleared him to contest the March 7, 2022 governorship primaries. In a statement released to journalists by the Media & Strategy arm of Adeleke Campaign Organisation, the former Senator was said to have expressed appreciation to the committee and the national leadership of the party for standing by truth and justice. The statement partly reads: “My ambition to govern Osun state is people-driven. We are not afraid to face the delegates at the primary and the people of Osun state at the general election. I urge my colleagues to take the contest like a sporting race. “As for me, I repeat: we are not enemies; we want to serve; our ambition should not be a do or die affair. Let the delegates decide the candidate ; let the voters elect the governor”, Senator Adeleke said. “We must be mindful of our actions as we belong to the same party and family. We must be getting set for a united front to defeat our common enemy (All Progressives Congress,” the guber aspirant advised.
