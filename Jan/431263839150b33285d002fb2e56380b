Dettol has thrown its weight behind Nigeria’s Super Eagles competing at the ongoing 33rd Africa Nations Cup (AFCON) in Cameroon by ensuring the health and hygiene of the team. The players and officials of the national team have been equipped with Dettol products that provide them with adequate protection from illness-causing germs before, during and after the AFCON tournament. In June 2021, Dettol became the ‘Official Hygiene Partner of the Super Eagles when it signed a deal with the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF). The objective of the partnership is to leverage Nigerians’ love for football to raise their health consciousness and to promote hygienic practices that will become habits. The general manager, Reckitt Sub-Saharan Africa, Akbar Shah said “Football is a unifier that brings Nigerians from all walks of life together. A vital part of healthy living is good hygiene, and no other brand in Nigeria epitomizes this like Dettol, for over 55 years, Dettol has helped to protect Nigerian lives and reduce the burden of illnesses.” Shah added, “Dettol will provide hygienic protection for the Super Eagles during their pre- and post-match activities during their AFCON tournament matches in Cameroon, powering them on their quest to bring home the 2021 African Cup of Nations and over 200 million Nigerians will be cheering them on. The Super Eagles can focus on giving their best because they know they have the Dettol protection.” At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dettol took the leadership in driving hygiene awareness amongst Nigerians, and with the same commitment, it is extending its efforts towards protecting the Super Eagles and its fans by bringing the football games back to normalcy with its gold standard hygiene protection.
