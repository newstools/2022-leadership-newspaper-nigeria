Ahead of the February 26 national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the Senate Chief Whip and former Abia state governor, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, on Sunday evening, paid a solidarity visit to a leading national chairmanship aspirant of the party, Senator Sani Musa. Kalu, who is also a presidential aspirant on the platform of the governing APC, said he was at the Maitama residence of the Senate Services Committee chairman on a solidarity visit. LEADERSHIP learnt that the recuperating chairmanship aspirant just returned from a medical trip abroad. Kalu praised the chairmanship aspirant for being very proactive and in pursuance of ways to move the APC to electoral victories in all elections. The former Abia governor, however, informed the Senator of his preparedness to aspire for the presidency of the country if the party zoned the position to the South. It was gathered the two leaders discussed ways of improving the fortunes of the party, how to ensure a rancour-free forthcoming national convention of the party and agreed to work together for the electoral success of the APC at all levels in future elections. Senator Sani Musa expressed gratitude to the Senate Chief Whip for deeming it fit to visit and check on him after his treatment. He thanked Senator Kalu for his humility and sense of leadership.
