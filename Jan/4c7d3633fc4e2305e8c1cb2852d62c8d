In a bid to ensure what they called a resounding success for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in this year’s gubernatorial election in Ekiti State, the two contending groups in the party, the Osoko Political Assembly (OPA) led by former Governor Ayo Fayose and Repositioning Group led by the Senator representing Ekiti South, Biodun Olujimi, met on Sunday and reaffirmed their readiness to work together. The meeting, which took place in Lagos, was personally attended by Fayose, Olujimi, Senator Duro Faseyi, Otunba Yinka Akerele and Hon. Deji Ogunsakin. “The two groups once again want to reassure the entire PDP members in Ekiti State in particular, that the ongoing talks and reconciliation will lead us all to the desired victory. “The groups admonished all stakeholders to embrace peace before, during and after the primaries. “While thanking our national chairman and the entire National Working Committee (NWC) members for their immense support so far, we want to assure the leaders that we are committed to the understanding we had with the party,” the statement jointly signed by Fayose and Olujimi stated.
