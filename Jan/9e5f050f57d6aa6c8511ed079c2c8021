Analysts have said that the positive performance witnessed in the Nigerian stock market is expected to be maintained this week on the market’s reaction to positive full year, 2021 corporate releases. Analysts Optimism Analysts at Cordros Securities Limited stated that “With the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting aligning with market expectations amid negative real returns in the fixed income market, they expect investors to continue to cherry-pick stocks with attractive dividend yields. “However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the fragility of the macroeconomic environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” In the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited expect the equities market to sustain its bullish momentum as corporates continue to churn out their audited full year 2021 financial results. On market outlook, the chief operating officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Mr Ambrose Omordion said “We expect the market to sustain the trend on renewed positioning in fundamentally sound and dividend paying stocks, as oil price rebounds to touch $90 per barrel, which is one factor that also continues to support economic and market fundamentals. “Also, investors are targeting dividend paying stocks as they reposition portfolios ahead of full year, 2021 earnings reports that may start hitting the market any moment from now.”  Last Week’s Trading Activities The domestic bourse last week sustained its bargain hunting activity as investors showed positive sentiment towards retention of Monetary Policy Rate at 11.50 per cent by Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). Also, the relatively positive corporates’ unaudited financial results stimulated investor’s interest.
