Former England midfielder, Frank Lampard, has been appointed Everton manager on a two-and-a-half-year deal. The 43-year-old replaces Rafael Benitez, who was sacked earlier this month after one win in 13 games. It is Lampard’s first job since he was sacked by Chelsea a year ago with Thomas Tuchel taking his role. “It is a huge honour for me to represent and manage a club with the size and tradition of Everton,” said Lampard. “I’m very hungry to get started,” he added. Lampard’s first match in charge will be Saturday’s FA Cup fourth-round tie against Brentford at Goodison Park.
