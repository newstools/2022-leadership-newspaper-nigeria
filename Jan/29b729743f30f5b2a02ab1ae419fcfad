The All Progressives Congress (APC) Imo State chapter has called on Senator Rochas Okorocha, a former governor of Imo State, to consider the option of resigning  as the senator representing Imo West having shown what it termed;  “unpardonable incompetence”. The party hinged its call for Okorocha’s resignation on what it described as poor and dismal performance in the senate. The state chairman of APC, Hon  Macdonald Ebere, stated this in a statement signed by Cajetan Duke, the publicity secretary of the party in the state. “Imo people have had enough of Okorocha and his family, who they consider as unfit to occupy any public office in Nigeria anymore given their poor and dismal performance in the state. “Our party condemns without reservations the futile attempt by Senator  Rochas Okorocha to vilify the governor, distinguished Senator Hope Uzodinma on Arise Television interview with wild claims, accusations and allegations filled with hate and vehemence. “Instead of presenting himself as a good ‘presidential material,’ Okorocha is busy carrying on in a brazen manner, marring his chances, rubbishing himself by trying to tarnish the image of Governor Uzodimma with lies, unsubstantiated accusations and fabrications like the alleged Hope Strike Force. “We are aware that Okorocha is a master of Ostrich politics and grandstanding, which he used to deceive Imo people for eight locust-infested years but this time he has failed. “Indeed, if Okorocha has serious or incriminating evidence against Governor Uzodinma, we thought the best place to report to go is the police and not mass media. “For the umpteenth time, Gov  Hope Uzodimma has stated that he has nothing personal against Okorocha but only bent on actualizing the mandate of the people,” the party said. It urged Okorocha to refrain from his distractions and allow Governor Uzodimma to focus on delivering good governance to Imo people.
