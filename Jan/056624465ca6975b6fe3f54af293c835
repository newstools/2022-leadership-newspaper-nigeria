Capital market analysts noted that total equities market transactions moderated in 2021 compared to the value of transactions executed in the corresponding period of 2020. The decline in total transaction was chiefly due to the weak appetite of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) amid fears of foreign exchange volatility eroding their returns on investment. They, however, said local investors dominate the equities market as they accumulated more shares to take position in some fundamentally sound stocks following the release of corporates’ nine months financial results which were largely positive. Analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited stated that, “the domestic stock market was generally bearish in the first half of the year as investors shifted base to the fixed income space given the significant rise in rates; thus, taking advantage of the uptrend in relatively less risky interest rates. “Specifically, we saw the stop rate for 364-day T-Bills surge to 9.75 per cent in May 2021 from a very low level of 1.14 per cent in December 2020. The bourse however took a positive turn in H2 2021 as local institutional investors swooped on shares for relatively better dividend yields as the T-Bills stop rate moderated to 4.9 per cent in December 2021. “Also, the interest of the local institutional investors in the equities space picked in Q3, 2021 following the release of corporates’ nine months financial results which were largely positive, even as it further substantiated the capacity of the companies to sustain good dividend payouts in full year, 2021. As investors flocked to the local stock market, the benchmark index finally closed in green territory at the end of 2021.”
