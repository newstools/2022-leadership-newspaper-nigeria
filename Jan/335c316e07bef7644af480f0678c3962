Arising from the cancellation of his scheduled trip to Zamfara State on Thursday due to inclement weather conditions, President Muhammadu Buhari has made a broadcast to the people of the State. According to a statement by Presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, President Buhari in the video broadcast said” My dear people of Zamfara State. It pains me that I can no longer be with you today as I had planned. I had just finished what I came to do in Sokoto at the BUA cement facility and was looking forward to meeting you. I have been told that the trip cannot hold anymore because of bad weather which has made it impossible for my helicopter to fly to Gusau from Sokoto. Buhari Cancels Trip To Zamfara Over ‘Bad Weather’ I understand how you feel about this development but I know that you will agree with me that Allah knows best. I particularly sympathise with your Governor, Bello Matawalle and his cabinet who have put everything in place to make the visit a successful one. I look forward to a more weather-friendly period when I will visit. I am directing our security agencies to sustain the onslaught against terrorists, restrict cross-boundary infiltration and all unauthorised access to the goldmines in the state. The federal government and the Zamfara State government are working to ensure that peace returns to all parts of the State in the shortest possible time and we expect all citizens to cooperate with, and support in all ways, the Armed Forces and other security agencies.
