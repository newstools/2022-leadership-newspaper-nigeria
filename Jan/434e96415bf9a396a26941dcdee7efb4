President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness about the fresh killings in Bassa local government area of Plateau State, saying circle of violence in the name of retaliation is unacceptable. The President noted that the latest incident in the state was not in keeping with the principles of the peace agreements reached between the Irigwes and the Fulanis in Bassa LGA. “My thoughts are with the families of the victims in this time of grief. May their souls rest in peace,” the President said in a statement by his media aide, Garba Shehu, while urging the various communities in the area, and particularly the Plateau State Interreligious Council to do everything possible to commit to the peace agreement and prevent it from falling apart. “Every group taking the law into their hands claims to be retaliating. As a society, there is no place for this sort of violence. This is unacceptable,” the President added. The President, however, commended Governor Simon Lalong for the state government’s handling of the incident so far.
