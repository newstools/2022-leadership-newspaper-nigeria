Analysts from securities companies are optimistic of stock market uptrend this week on Dangote Cement Plc shares buy-back programme and positioning for 2021 full year financial results.  Analysts Optimism Analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited say they expect the equities market index to further rise as investors buy more shares, especially Dangote Cement Plc, as it rounds up the shares buy-back programme in the new week. In the short term, analysts at Cordros Securities Limited expect the bulls to retain dominance in the market given positioning for 2021 full year dividends as institutional investors continue to search for clues on the direction of yields in the fixed income (FI) market, saying, “notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” However, analysts at Afrinvest Limited stated that, “in the coming week, we expect market performance to be a mix of profit-taking and bargain hunting activities.”  Last Week’s Trading Activities Sentiments remained broadly bullish in the second trading week of the year as investors continued to cherry-pick stocks with attractive dividend yields ahead of 2021 full year dividend declarations.
