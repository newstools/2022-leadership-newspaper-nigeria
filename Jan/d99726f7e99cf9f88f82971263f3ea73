Tunisia have been hit by a COVID-19 outbreak in their camp at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) and could have as many as 12 players unavailable for their last group game against Gambia today, Tunisian Football Federation said yesterday. Tunisia, who have three points from their opening two games, would be seeking at least one more point to make sure they qualify for the last 16, if not one among the top two in Group F then as one of the four best third placed finishers. Wahbi Khazri, who scored twice in their 4-0 win over Mauritania on Sunday, leads the list of players who have subsequently tested positive. Ghailane Chaalali and Ali Maaloul, who also impressed on Sunday, are set to miss out along with replacements Mohamed Amine Ben Hamida, Mohamed Ali Ben Romdhane, Aymen Dahmen and Ali Jemal. But Tunisia did receive a boost with Dylan Bronn, Mohamed Drager and Naim Sliti the latest to return negative tests and come out of isolation, a spokesman said.
