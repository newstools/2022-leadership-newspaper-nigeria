The chief executive officer of Styl Nouveau Nigeria Limited, Arc. Bremfte Sajo, has said that love and fear of God were the hallmark of a successful marriage. Sajo, who was the chairman at the holy matrimony of Valentine and Chidinma Abiji, made the charge at the couple’s reception ceremony held in Abuja on Saturday. He said, “My advice to the couple is that they should embrace love and fear of God and to live happily thereafter.” Also speaking, the Senator representing Cross River North senatorial district, who served as the Father of the Day, Senator Agom Jarigbe, said that, the only way to have a lasting marriage is solely to put God first as well as give peace a room to reign. “The couple is to pray hard and remain as one because everything is only possible with God,” Agom said. Also, speaking about their love life, the couple (Valentine and Chidinma) described love as a wind. “You can’t see it but you can feel it, not even the resounding effect of a whirlwind can equate the tenacity of our love. You are my evergreen,” said Valentine. Dignitaries including family members, friends and well wishers were in attendance to make the day colourful for the couple.
