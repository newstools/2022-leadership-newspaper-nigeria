The Nigeria Rugby Football Federation (NRFF) has taken a frontline approach to grassroots sports development with the intention to take the game of rugby to universities and other tertiary institutions in the country. The NRFF president, Ademola Are, who revealed this in an exclusive chat with LEADERSHIP Sports recently in Abuja, said the move is aimed at rejuvenating the domestic league where the both Northern and Southern teams will come to compete together. To actualize the laudable initiative, Are said the Federation has been in touch with the chairman of Nigeria’s leading sports marketing company, Pamodzi Sports Marketing Firm, Chief Mike Itemuagbor for its marketing drive. “As part of our programmes, we intend to go grassroots, ensuring that we have programmes in all the six geopolitical zones simultaneously and from there we intend to go to the Universities and other tertiary institutions to give opportunity to our elite sport by rejuvenating the league. We want to have the Northern and southern teams come together under one league and produce a national champion. “To achieve all these we needed finance and in looking for finance we have been in touch with the chairman of Pamodzi Sports Marketing Nig Ltd, Chief Mike Itemuagbor, who has shown very much interest in rugby. “Also, Honourable Minister of Youth and Sports, Chief Sunday Dare, has been our backbone so far and we are looking forward to more support from the Ministry. The Permanent secretary, Mr Ismail Abubakar has also been forthcoming to us. So, we look forward to the Ministry because there is nothing we can really do without their backing. Are also appealed to spirited individuals for support. “All other spirited individuals that can add value to rugby, our door is widely open for you. We are open to members of the community and public”
