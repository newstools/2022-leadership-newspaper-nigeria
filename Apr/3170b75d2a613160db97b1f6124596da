Unknown gunmen, suspected to be assassins on Thursday night broke into the Port Harcourt residence of a frontiline governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Prince Tonye Princewill. Princewill, in a text message sent to journalists in Port Harcourt on Friday, however, said he was not at home when the hoodlums visited. The message reads: “Just getting reports that my house was broken in to last night. Nothing taken. Clearly an assassination attempt. It is God we have to thank oh.”  Details Later..
