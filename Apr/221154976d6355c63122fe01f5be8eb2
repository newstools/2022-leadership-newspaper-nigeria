The Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) has extended the completion date for the seventh National Action Plan (NAP 7.0) to May 6, 2022. This, it said, is in line to continuously improve the business environment in Nigeria through reforms. According to a statement from firm, the extension of the 30-day window is to enable affected ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) to improve on their overall performance, which has so far been suboptimal. The council, at its meeting held in January 2022, had approved the commencement of NAP 7.0 to run from February 7, 2022 to April 7, 2022, with a target to deliver 57 reforms within the 60-day accelerator window, but at the mid-way point on March 8, the completion rate was 26 per cent. To this end, with recent interventions by the head of the civil service of the federation and relevant permanent secretaries, there is the likelihood that more reforms may be delivered by the new deadline as affected MDAs are given additional time for the completion of their reforms. However, with this extension, PEBEC expect the reforms to include streamlining and simplification of ago-export regulatory practices to boost the competitiveness of Nigeria’s agro-exports while enhancing Nigeria’s foreign exchange earnings are as stated in the Agro-Export Plan. Other reforms include; a drive for increased adoption of electronic filing of taxes by taxpayers and it is expected that, at the end of the 30-day extension, several reforms would have been delivered as part of efforts to make Nigeria a progressively easier place to do business. In her remarks on the extension, PEBEC secretary and special adviser to the president on Ease of Doing Business, Dr Jumoke Oduwole,  stated that, “the Council is deeply concerned about the situation and accordingly this the extension was granted to provide ample time for ministries, departments and agencies to conclude on their outstanding reforms.” Among the participating MDAs include; the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), Trademarks Registry (Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment), Citizens and Business Department (Ministry of Interior), Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), among others.
