The apex socio-political organisation in Lagos State, Governance Advisory Council (GAC), has approved the second term bid of incumbent Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. According to Governor Sanwo-Olu’s chief press secretary, Gboyega Akosile, on Monday, he said GAC okayed the governor’s second term aspiration for “staying through to the developmental agenda of Lagos.” Akosile, who took to his verified Twitter handle, wrote: “The Governance Advisory Council at a meeting in Lagos on Monday gave pass mark to Sanwo-Olu for staying through to the developmental agenda of Lagos. Congratulations Dear Boss!” With this development, Sanwo-Olu will get the support of Lagos APC to seek a second term in office and likely with no intra-party opposition.
