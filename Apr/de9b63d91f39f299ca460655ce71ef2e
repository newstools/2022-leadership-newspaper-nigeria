The enthusiasm of youths across the 36 states of the federation for politics is being dampened by the high cost of nomination forms of the major political parties for various elective positions, compelling some of the young ones to drop out of the races. The cost of nomination and expression of interest forms for the presidential ticket of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) is N100 million, the governorship forms cost N50m, while the senatorial and House of Representatives tickets are pegged at N20 million and N10 million respectively, even as forms for the state assemblies are being sold for N2 million. The cost of the nomination forms of the opposition PDP are also just as expensive. Though young people, especially those under the age of 40, are only expected to pay half the cost for any given elective office, LEADERSHIP Weekend findings showed that the price tag is still out of reach for many young aspiring politicians. But national chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, however, said the party has no regrets pegging its presidential nomination forms at N100 million. Adamu stated this yesterday while fielding questions from State House correspondents at the presidential villa after presenting the party’s gubernatorial candidate in the Ekiti governorship election to President Muhammadu Buhari. He was accompanied by the party’s national secretary, Senator Iyiola Omisore, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, and Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu. According to the chairman, the party did its homework before arriving at the price. Giving reasons why the fee was justified, Adamu said, “On the issue of cost, yeah, I have been listening with rapt attention to the hues and cries from our lovers and our adversaries. We have no regrets whatsoever. “We did some homework; we know what it takes to go through primaries, go through the presidential campaign, and go through election for the president. We know what it takes. “We also do know that there are citizens who are qualified to contests, but who are not serious contenders; who will just want to make anything cheaply by the roadside and assert what they call their rights and create problems for our party. “We’re also aware that some parties that have no chance whatsoever to win the presidential election in Nigeria, will sponsor people into parties that have prospects for winning the election, to create problems for us, to divert our attention, whichever party is involved in that. “Over and above that, yes, we are the ruling party. Yes, we need to set examples in what we do, but I ask you. I don’t know which part of the country you come from. If God forbid, your traditional ruler dies today, contestants to that office will go for more than N100 million; it’s no news. Citing himself as an instance of the rate at which the fees have increased over the years, Adamu recalled that when he contested for the Senate, all he paid was just a token of N5 million and N10 million respectively, including the expression of interest form. He continued: “When my colleague wanted to be chairman of the party, in the days of Adams Oshimhole, it cost him N500,000. Today, for me, just as an example, to contest the national chairman of our party, I had to pay N20 million to contest. <img class="size-medium wp-image-375867 alignleft" src="//i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/APC-forms.png?resize=600%2C344&#038;ssl=1" alt="political ambitions" width="600" height="344" srcset="//i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/APC-forms.png?resize=600%2C344&amp;ssl=1 600w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/APC-forms.png?w=712&amp;ssl=1 712w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1"> “And even the enormity of work that has to be done (in APC) will be done with the money. We don’t want to continue begging. “So, I want to say that we are able to mobilize sufficient funds to support our efforts to win the election. Some protests may be well-founded. I do not quarrel with that, but the propensity of this that people just assume ‘it’s the ruling party, is a quick… in our democracy. “I will not quarrel with that; every one of us has the right to express himself, and I’m in full support of these obligations. But we wear the shoes for our party and we know where it pinches us the most. The national chairman hinted that the APC was yet to determine where it wants to zone its presidential ticket to. “I am today privileged to be the chairman of the party. The party is greater than me. The party has not made a decision and I cannot preempt what the position will be,” he noted. But LEADERSHIP observed that while rich party bigwigs are purchasing forms for politicians with big names and those considered as influential, young Nigerians aspiring for elective offices in the 2023 polls are being frustrated out of the contest by lack of funds. The coordinator Plateau Youth Progressive Congress (PYPC), Comrade Prince Miaphen, had wanted to pick the nomination forms for the state House of Assembly but was constrained by lack of money. He expressed regret that some of them who did not hold any political position before cannot afford to pay for the forms. “Where do you they think we will get this huge amount  to pay for our forms,” Miaphen asked, pointing out that despite the discount given by APC, many of the youths cannot afford to pay for the form. He lamented that the development has crippled most of them who wanted to delve into politics. It was also gathered that some of the aspirants in Kaduna State that hitherto sought to participate in the politics of 2023 have withdrawn their participation on account of high cost of forms by the political parties. One of such aspirants is John Femi Adi, a Kaduna based journalist, who had indicated interest to contest for Kogi West Senatorial seat on the platform of the APC which pegged its nomination forms at N20 million for the Senate seat. He said there is no way he could afford such money even if he sells off all his property; hence, his decision to withdraw his ambition. “I certainly cannot afford N20 million, even if I sell my properties. The high cost of nomination forms is to discourage young people and pave way for those in power to continue,” he lamented. Also, a young politician in Cross River State, Eteng Sunday, who claimed he had participated in the student union politics during his university days at the University of Calabar, said cannot take part in the ongoing political process due to high cost of nomination forms. This, he said, has indeed affected the enthusiasm of young people from seeking political offices. Mohammed Baba Aji, a youth aspiring for the Damaturu Central seat in the Yobe state House of Assembly said, “We have vibrant youths that can contribute positively to the growth of our people but due to this amount, many have no option than to shelve their ambitions. “Though, I am happy to hear that those below the age of 40 were given some waiver of which I am a beneficiary, it could be better if the cost could be lower.” Also Nura Dalhatu, another youth aspiring for the state assembly in Bade local government area said the price is too much for young aspirants like him. “I think at most, the cost of both the expression of interest and nomination form should not be more than N500,000,00. This, for me, is okay, and affordable.” But, another aspirant from Potiskum local government area, ALhaji Abdullahi Agwai, said, “Based on the political atmosphere in the country, the amount fixed for both expression of interest and nomination form is okay for me.” In Rivers State, the high cost of nomination and expression of interest forms has discouraged a lot of young people from seeking elective offices in the 2023 general election. Speaking with LEADERSHIP Weekend, a young politician, Lucky Appolos, said he lost interest in running for a seat in the Rivers State House of Assembly when the APC announced the amount for forms. Appolos said: “I was planning to contest to represent my constituency in the Rivers State House of Assembly. I had even started consultations when APC announced the amount to purchase form. I lost interest.” Also, the high cost of nomination forms is hindering youths’ participation in the electoral process in Kwara State. Some politically-inclined youths who spoke with our reporter in Ilorin, the state capital, condemned the high cost of nomination forms rolled out by the political parties. A youthful politician, Hakeem Dan- Baruba, said his ambition of gunning for a state House of Assembly seat has been truncated by the high cost of nomination forms. Also, the youngest gubernatorial aspirant in the state, Baba Idris, noted that the cost of nomination forms, especially that of the APC is on high side. “Where do you expect the unemployed youths to get money to obtain the parties’ nomination form?” A public affairs analyst, Kunle Jimoh, asked rhetorically. He said the parties have, by the fixing of the cost of their nomination forms, defeated the purpose of the ‘ Not Too Young To Rule Bill”. On his part, Christopher Ojo, an aspirant to the House of Representatives seat condemned the high cost placed on expression of interest and nomination forms by political parties ahead of the 2023 general elections. Ojo who stated this in a chat with journalists in Benin on Thursday said the high cost negates the essence of the “Not Too Young To Run Act.” He noted that many youths who are willing and ready to participate in the forthcoming elections have been discouraged with the development. He said, “If not indirectly telling us to wait for more time or perhaps, be involved in corrupt act, where do they expect us (youths) to get this huge amount of money from to buy just form. “From what i have seen so far, there is no party that sells forms below N3 million, forgetting that much more money will be spent in campaigns and other logistics. “Tell me, how many of us can really afford this cost and yet, they preached to us about inclusive participation. Ojo is an aspirant of the APC for Owan Federal Constituency. Former Councillor of Lugere ward in Jimeta, the Adamawa State capital, Jatau kuza, lamented the high cost of APC nomination forms, which denied him opportunities to contest an elective position. Kuza, a father of two, told LEADERSHIP Weekend that after realizing the cost of the nomination form, he had to withdraw his ambition to contest. “Times are hard. I cannot afford the money for the form. By implication, APC officials don’t want people like me who are unemployed to join the race. That is why the party increased the money for the forms”, he added. In Kebbi State, Abubakar Geda who is contesting for Kebbi Central Senatorial seat told our correspondent in Birnin Kebbi that there is no way APC can sell all the forms because most of the aspirants cannot afford to buy the forms. He noted that only those who steal from the coffers of the government could be able to purchase the form. Also, Abubakar Na’amore Argungu who is contesting the Kebbi State House of Assembly seat in Kebbi North lamented that he is at risk of losing over 500,000 supporters from his constituency if in the end he cannot afford to purchase the forms. Hajiya Tasha Zuru who is seeking to contest House of Representative saet in Kebbi South called on APC leaders to reduce the cost so that common aspirants like them can afford to buy it She said she was optimistic of victory if she contested but said, with this development there is no way she could obtain the form. Similarly, some youth activists in Gombe state lamented the high cost of nomination forms for elective offices under the platform of the ruling party APC. According to one of them, Idris Abubakar, the new price of nomination forms in the ruling party is capable of ruining the political ambitions of many energetic and intellectual youths that have the capacity to lead. Confirming this, the Gombe State APC publicity secretary, Moses Kyari, disclosed that so far, no candidate in the state has bought forms or has even shown interest to vie for the governorship position under the party apart from the incumbent governor, Inuwa Yahaya. In Oyo, the national president, Yoruba Youth Socio-cultural Association (YYSA), Comrade Olalekan Hammed, said despite the fact that APC gives special consideration to people with disability, women and youth, the amount placed on the form was unduly high. According to him, many of the APC youths find it difficult to purchase the forms. He said some youths who were jostling to become governors, senators and others without deep pockets have been systematically kicked-out, adding that many of them who didn’t have sponsors had since buried their ambition. “Take for example, the Expression of Interest and Nomination form for the House of Senator is N20 million⁰. There is no way you will not spend above ten million naira on both Expression of Interest and Nomination forms even with the 50% reduction in nomination form given as privilege to youth (men),” he noted. In Enugu, our investigations revealed that the high cost of nomination forms has affected women and the youths negatively. For instance, it was observed that no woman purchased the governorship forms of the People’s Democratic Party. The party is almost getting close to its delegate election. It was further gathered that no woman has so far indicated interest to contest for any position under the platform of the APC. Speaking with LEADERSHIP Weekend in Enugu, a prominent female politician, Ifeoma Duru, expressed disappointment over the high cost of nomination form. Duru, a former senatorial aspirant said the development was part of plans by political parties to marginalise women in politics. She regretted that the development made her withdraw her aspiration, adding that she knew so many women that also withdrew because of the sad development. Widely condemned as too exorbitant, the N50 million fixed for the nomination and expression of interest forms by the APC for gubernatorial aspirants has put paid to the ambition of many. A youthful governorship aspirant on the platform of the party in Sokoto State, Mas’ud Musa Bashir, has also temporarily put his ambition on hold. Spokesman to Mas’ud Bashir, Comrade Abdul Aliyu, told our correspondent that the campaign team put together by the aspirant will soon come out with a final position after a meeting to be convened by the aspirant. Comrade Aliyu hinted that Mas’ud’s projected budget to contest the party primary was in the region of N60 million. “Now that the party has come out with a price of N50 million for nomination and expression of interest forms alone, do you think N10 million would be adequate for logistics? “We shall soon meet to review the situation and come out with a position, taking into consideration the interest of our teeming supporters. “Our aspirant is not a senseless moneybag. He is a vibrant, hardworking businessman who works diligently for his money. I think he will rather divest such hard earned money into his philanthropic programmes,” Aliyu stated. A senatorial aspirant under the platform of the APC, Comrade John Femi Adi, who is contesting for Kogi West senatorial zone, also lamented the high cost of APC nomination forms, saying even if he sells his properties, farm and car it would be impossible for him to purchase nomination form. Adi, a media practitioner who was reacting to the high cost of APC nomination forms in Kaduna said, “N20 Million Naira to buy forms? Kai! If I sell my houses, farm, car and other personal properties ,it is obvious that I can’t afford this huge amount of money. This is grossly unfair to those of us who are willing to serve our people”. Another APC aspirant, Mordecai Sunday Ibrahim, who is contesting for the Kaduna State House of Assembly seat in 2023 polls said, “Now we have been screened out of the contest with that whooping N2m nomination forms fees.” Babachir, Faleke, Others Pick N100m Forms For Tinubu Meanwhile, a former secretary to government of the federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal and a member of the House of Representatives representing Ikeja Federal constituency, James Faleke, yesterday led thousands of members of the Tinubu Support Groups (TSG) to purchase presidential expression of interest and nomination forms pegged at N100 million for national leader of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Members of TSG, an umbrella organization for hundreds of groups working to actualise Tinubu’s presidential ambition, thronged the International Conference Centre (ICC) to purchase the forms. Speaking with journalists after purchasing the forms, Lawal described Tinubu as a branded product. He said, “Every Nigerian knows that he is the man to beat and I can assure you that the presidency of Nigeria come 29th May 2023 will go to Tinubu. “If we were not sure we have chances to win this election, we would not waste our N100 million. Everybody’s free to buy the forms if he has N100 million. The choice is his own. He has the money. “But as far as we are concerned, we are only fulfilling the constitutional requirement of campaigning and going for election. We don’t foresee any opposition in the contest. We are not worried in our camp, I am not worried as a person”. On his part, Faleke said the Tinubu camp is not jittery about the mode of primaries, as it is prepared for any method that would be adopted by the party. The federal lawmaker said, “It is the party that has the authority to advocate for the mode of primaries. It is not in our purview to do that whatever mode, direct or indirect, we will win the election by the grace of God. “Asiwaju at the appropriate time will deliver his address to us but I know that this country under Tinubu will be better off. The economy will be better off because he is an economist, he is not a lawyer, he is an economist. “He will deal with the economic situation of this country. He did it in Lagos, and the security challenges in Lagos were solved by him. He will solve the same security challenges. “He is a man who rewards loyalty and ensures that people who work are also taken care of. He will ensure that employment opportunities are better off; the issue of strikes will be a thing of the past. Civil service reform was done in Lagos, he will do it again in Nigeria and so on and so forth.”
