Ahead of the 2023 general election, a presidential aspirant on the platform of Young Progressive Party (YPP), Prince Malik Ado-Ibrahim, has said Nigerians deserve a healthy, not frail, president. Ado-Ibrahim who disclosed this during a programme titled: “Dialogue with YPP Presidential Aspirant”, yesterday in Abuja, said Nigerians deserve a president who will roll up his sleeves and fight for the country’s greatness. The presidential aspirant who is the Ohinoyi of Ebiraland son, said his intention to run for the presidential election in 2023 was because of the leadership vacuum in the country. According to him, “I really pray that Nigerians look at the visions of the next president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and what he is willing to do. We don’t want frail leaders, I want to see a president that will roll up his sleeves and fight for you, fight for greatness.” The 59-year-old said in advanced countries people of his age are considering retiring from politics adding that Nigerians should not vote for a party that has failed them in the next election. “What we need now is somebody who can change the narrative of the country, not a party. We need a visionary, not a symbol. I didn’t come here carrying an umbrella or a broom. I am a proud Nigerian. Nigeria is my problem, it is your problem, it is for every single person standing up,” he said. He challenged Nigerians to look at the visions of the presidential aspirants and what they are willing to do. “Your president is a reflection of your country. Do they represent you? We have to ask one question to an aspirant, what have we done? Then if he can’t answer that question, ask, what will you do? A visionary says what he will do,” he added.
