In his remarks, ITF Calabar area manager, Vincent Iyam, urged the trainees not to sell the starter packs given to them by ITF but the starter packs be put into use so that they can become employers of labour and other Nigerians suffering from the pain of unemployment can also be assisted. “Please, as you go out there in the labour market, try at all cost that any contract given to you by your client is strictly executed without any hitch. “Don’t divert any kobo meant for execution of any job given to you by your client. It is only when you show diligence, discipline and mastery of your work to prove to your clients that you know your onions that people would look for you to give you more jobs,” Iyam added.
