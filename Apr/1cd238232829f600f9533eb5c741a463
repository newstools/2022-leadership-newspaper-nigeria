Former president, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, yesterday urged Nigerians not to vote for presidential aspirants who he said were “lying” that some persons bought nomination forms for them, saying such antic of deceiving the electorate must not be encouraged. Chief Obasanjo who stated this in Lagos at a colloquium with the theme; “The African Christian Leadership: Radical Transformation in Unsettled Times” to mark the 61st birthday of Pastor Itua Ighodalo, said Nigeria’s problem was entirely about leadership. According to him, the Constitution which many have attributed to Nigeria’s challenges was crafted by the military that gathered the best brains in the land at that time to draft it. He said; “Today, they are paying N40m. Some of them (aspirants) even said it is some youths who bought it for them. In fact, anybody who would come out to tell you such a lie, you shouldn’t vote for him. Which youths gathered N40m? If you want to buy it, buy it and tell us. You don’t need to lie to us.” He said the problems confronting Nigeria at the moment can only be surmounted by good leadership, noting that Nigeria needed a change of leadership. “If you say, what is wrong with Nigeria, it is leadership. If you say, what do you have to do about Nigeria, it is leadership. If you say, where are we taking Nigeria? Leadership.’’ According to him, even if Nigeria gathers the best constitutions in the world, if those who would implement are not people with the right attitude and orientation, nothing positive can be achieved and the country’s progress would be retarded. It would be recalled that politicians have been coming out to declare that people are pressuring them to run for presidency and even bought nomination forms for them.
