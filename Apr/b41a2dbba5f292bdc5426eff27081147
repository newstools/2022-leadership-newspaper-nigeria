20 Pensions Fund Administrators (PFAs) have scaled through the N5 billion pension industry recapitalisation exercise whose deadline was April 27, 2022, it was learnt yesterday. The National Pension Commission (PenCom) had mandated all the 22 PFAs to recapitalise from their previous N1billion to N5 billion with a 12-month transition period beginning from April 27, 2021 to April 27, 2022. A statement from the commission made available to LEADERSHIP yesterday noted that all pension fund administrators have complied with the directive, although there were mergers and acquisitions in the process which shrank the number of PFAs from 22 to 20. Stating that 10 PFAs had met the new regulatory capital requirement of N5 billion as at December 31 2021, it added that others were equally able to beat the deadline. “This resulted in some mergers and acquisitions which led to the reduction of the number of PFAs from 22 to 20. The commission approved the acquisition of AllCO Pension Managers Limited by FCMB Pensions Limited and the merger between Tangerine Pensions Limited and APT Pension Funds Managers Limited as well as subsequent change of name of the merged entity to Tangerine APT Pensions Limited. The commission also approved Norrenberger’s acquisition of IEI-Anchor Pension Managers Limited, after its acquisition of the majority shareholder, IEI PIc,” it pointed out. With the conclusion of the recapitalisation exercise, it said, stakeholders, particularly Retirement Savings Account (RSA) holders should expect increased effectiveness and efficiency as well as improved service delivery from PFAs. The exercise, according to PenCom, became expedient as the value of pensions fund assets under management and custody had grown exponentially by 244 per cent, from N3 trillion in 2012 (when the previous recapitalisation was done) to N12.29 trillion (as at December 31, 2020).
