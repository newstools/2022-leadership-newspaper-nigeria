As Nigeria Muslims commence the annual Ramadan fast, Ekiti State  Dr. Kayode Fayemi and his Oyo State counterpart Governor, Seyi Makinde at the weekend urged the Muslims to pray relentlessly for peace in Nigeria during the fasting period.  The governors who felicitated with the Muslims in their states and across the country for witnessing the commencement of yet another Ramadan asked them to pray to the almighty Allah to show mercy on Nigerians at this time.  Governor Makinde in his Ramadan message said Muslims must embrace the piety demanded of them during the Ramadan and ask Allah to put an end to the insurgency which has been ravaging our Country. Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Fayemi, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olayinka Oyebode, described Ramadan as “the glory of all months in the Islamic calendar”, adding that Ramadan fast is one of the five pillars of Islam that Muslims must strictly adhere to in line with the injunction of the Almighty Allah. The Governor noted that Ramadan offers an opportunity to draw closer to Allah and deepen relationships with him. He therefore urged Muslims to use the period to pray for peace to reign in all the troubled spots in the country and in nations of the world. He also urged them to use the Ramadan season to pray for peace and prosperity in Ekiti State, especially the forthcoming governorship election in the state. He said through prayer and cooperation of the people, the state would witness a peaceful election and smooth transition of power to the eventual winner.
