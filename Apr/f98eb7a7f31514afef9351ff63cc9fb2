Super Eagles striker, Taiwo Awoniyi is being courted by Premier League clubs and has become the subject of a £25m move. According to GOAL, the former Liverpool attacker’s splendid performances at Union Berlin is catching the eye in England and he may be making a move pretty soon if the money is deemed too good to be rejected. West Ham, Southampton and Newcastle have been listed as potential destinations for the attacker who was on Liverpool’s books for six years without kicking a ball. He went on seven loan spells and the last was a major stint as he did enough to convince the capital club to splash £6.5m to tie him down. Union are a selling club and may listen to offers if it’s good for them. They sold Awoniyi’s strike partner Max Kruse to Wolfsburg in the January transfer window and may consider letting Awoniyi go as a decent option too. Awoniyi joined Liverpool in 2015 as an 18-year old but didn’t play as he didn’t have a work permit. The attacker has scored 16 goals in 35 games since he joined Union Berlin. He has become a full Nigerian international since then, representing the country in a major tournament earlier in the year and such issues will not be faced again. Liverpool are entitled to 10% of his eventual transfer fees should he be making a move this summer.
