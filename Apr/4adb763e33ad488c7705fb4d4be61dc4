The senator representing Imo West and All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant, Rochas Okorocha, yesterday said Nigeria at the moment needs a wealth creator who can identify and stimulate the economic potentials of the country and not a manager. He said majority of those in the presidential race were wealth managers who are not fit for the task of reengineering the country to work as the situation demands. Okorocha who spoke shortly after being presented the APC  presidential nomination form procured for him by the New Nigeria Movement promised to create wealth for Nigeria when elected president. He added that Nigeria’s current situation calls for a man with the capacity to engage Nigerian youths and women in the productive sector. Okorocha  advised APC delegates to vote wisely, adding, “I know you will be under intense pressure brought by religious, ethnic and political sentiments but one question you must ask yourself is what has been your gain . If you cast your vote by sentiment, don’t blame anyone later. “There are so many in the presidential race, I am not the best aspirant but I am who Nigeria needs to change the ugly narrative. In Nigeria we are going through abnormal situation, our country is associated with poverty, insecurity and others and an ideal person is needed to champion the nation. “Nigeria requires a builder, not a manager. What I see happening is that many managers are aspiring to manage the nation but you must build first bringing the managers. My only agenda is to create wealth for Nigerians.” Earlier, spokesman for the New Nigeria Movement, Prince Ebunola Martins, said the group was propelled to purchase the nomination form for the former Imo governor by the desire to rescue Nigeria.
