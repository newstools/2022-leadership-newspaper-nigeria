Yet-to-be identified assailants on Friday morning bombed the country home of the Imo State Commissioner for Labour, Employment and Productivity, Chief Ford Ozumba, in Umuhu Okabia, Orsu local government area of the state. Sources who pleaded anonymity said the assailants threw petrol bombs into the house which ignited the building. Chief Ozumba confirmed the incident even as he lamented the level of destruction. No life was lost as there was nobody in the building. He said, “We were all in Owerri only to learn this morning that my family house had been burnt down. I was told that the attackers wreaked the havoc in the cover of darkness. They threw petrol bomb into the compound.” LEADERSHIP reports that Ozumba is the third Commissioner to suffer such attack. Others were Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Chief Cyprian Akaolisa, and his Informationand Strategy counterpart, Chief Declan Emelumba. Assailants had in 2021 razed down the country home of the member representing Orsu state constituency, Hon. Ekene Nnodumele and beheaded his security guard, and only last month razed down that of the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Prof. George Obiozor. Efforts to get the reaction of Imo Statw Police spokesperson, CSP Michael Abattam, proved abortive as he did not pick calls placed to the phone as at press time.
