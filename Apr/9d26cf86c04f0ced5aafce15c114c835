Former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayo Fayose has assured members of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the state that their governorship candidate, Hon Bisi Kolawole will wrest power from the ruling All Progressives Congress and take the state back to the path of progress. Fayose, who was addressing the people of Aba Igbira, in Ado Ekiti during a campaign tour of some areas in the State capital, said “Ekiti State was already messed up by the APC government who took over from PDP in 2018, but as usual, PDP will fix the state.” According to a statement by the Spokesperson of the Bisi Kolawole Campaign Organisation, Lere Olayinka, the campaign tour touched Apata Natha, Nova and Aba Igbira areas of Ado Ekiti. He said people trooped out in their numbers to welcome the campaign train, assuring that their votes will go to the PDP. Kolawole, who was accompanied by his running mate, Barrister Kolapo Kolade and other PDP leaders, was described as “the perfect man to bring smiles to the faces of Ekiti people who are under the burden of a governor that is not accessible to even his party men.” Also speaking, Kolawole, who promised to take the welfare of the people as his topmost priority if elected as governor, said having lived in the midst of Ekiti people for over 20 years, he understood their plights and will address them.
