Savannah Energy Plc, has confirmed that its subsidiary, Accugas, has signed an addendum to its existing interruptible gas sales agreement, IGSA, with First Independent Power Limited, FIPL, originally signed on 28 January 2020. Accugas currently supplies up to 35 million standard cubic feet of gas a day,  MMscfpd  to FIPL’s Afam power plant. Under the terms of the addendum, FIPL will be able to increase the quantity of gas purchased from Accugas to up to 65 MMscfpd so as to also supply the Trans Amadi and Eleme power plants, in addition to its Afam power plant. The FIPL’s power plants have a total generation capacity of 391 MW, with the Trans Amadi and Eleme plants having generation capacities of 136MW and 75 MW, respectively.

The FIPL is an affiliate company of the Sahara Group, a leading international energy and infrastructure conglomerate with operations in over 42 countries across Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. CEO of Savannah Energy, Andrew Knott,  in his comments said:  “Accugas has recorded growth in Total Revenues from gas sales for each of the last five years, with a realised CAGR of 15%.
