Boris Becker, the former Wimbledon champion, has been jailed for two years and six months over bankruptcy offences, as a court heard “the most glittering of sporting careers” now lay in ruins. The 54-year-old hid assets and loans amounting to £2.5 million – including a luxury villa in Germany – from his creditors after he was declared bankrupt in 2017 over an unpaid £3 million loan on his estate in Mallorca. Financially in June 2017, successfully keeping £390,000 (€426,930) and the proceeds of a bank loan worth £1.1 million from his creditors. Becker, the former World Number One, also failed to declare his ownership of a £1 million German property and £75,000 in shares he held in a tech firm. The tennis great was made bankrupt after his £38 million sporting fortune was swallowed up by an expensive divorce, child maintenance, and the cost of continuing his luxury lifestyle. He told Southwark crown court how “Brand Becker” had been damaged by a series of scandals and negative press interest, harming his ability to earn money in sponsorship and punditry. He was convicted by a jury of four charges under the Insolvency Act, and was jailed on Friday by the Recorder of Westminster, Judge Deborah Taylor.
