A submarine cable named after Nigerian-born writer and abolitionist, Olaudah Equiano, has arrived in Lagos. This was announced on Thursday by Juliet Ehimuan, director, Google West Africa. The Equiano submarine becomes second to arrive in Africa after the first one landed in Togo. Last month, the submarine cable landed in Togo, and it is expected to run from Portugal along the West Coast of Africa connecting Europe to Togo, Nigeria, Namibia, South Africa and Saint Helena. Ehimuan said the cable has a special resonance for Nigeria, as it is named after Olaudah Equiano, a Nigerian-born writer and abolitionist. “Today, we’re thrilled to announce our second Africa landing in Lagos, Nigeria. While many subsea cables are named after historical luminaries, the Equiano cable has special resonance for Nigeria. It’s named after Olaudah Equiano, a Nigerian-born writer and abolitionist, so it’s landing in Lagos, Nigeria today is like a homecoming. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-373845" src="//i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220421-WA0113.jpg?resize=600%2C338&#038;ssl=1" alt="Google" width="600" height="338" srcset="//i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220421-WA0113.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220421-WA0113.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220421-WA0113.jpg?resize=180%2C100&amp;ssl=1 180w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220421-WA0113.jpg?resize=750%2C422&amp;ssl=1 750w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220421-WA0113.jpg?resize=1140%2C641&amp;ssl=1 1140w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220421-WA0113.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1"> “Nigeria is sub-Saharan Africa’s largest economy. Still, the share of people using the internet stood at approximately 35% as of 2020 – double what it was in 2012. Across much of the country, people lack affordable, reliable & quality access, which limits their ability to benefit from, and contribute to, the digital economy,” the statement said. Ehimuan said the subsea cable would benefit not just the government but businesses as well as individuals in multiple ways. She added that there would be a mutual agreement with key players to ensure a wider reach for consumers across Africa. “Since 2017, the Nigerian government has been actively working on its digital transformation programs as part of plans to grow its domestic sectors. These initiatives have proven pivotal to the success of many industries in the country, especially the startup space. In the last five years, startups in Nigeria have produced five unicorns (startups valued at over a billion dollars). Businesses are also benefiting significantly from the usage of internet platforms, with total e-commerce annual expenditure predicted to climb to $75 billion by 2025, up from its current projection of US $12 billion. “Equiano’s arrival in Nigeria is expected to result in faster internet speeds and significantly improve people’s experiences while online. Internet speeds in Nigeria are expected to grow almost six-fold by 2025, and retail internet prices are forecasted to decline by 21% over the same period. “The same study found that by 2025, real GDP in Nigeria is forecast to be USD 10.1 billion higher than it otherwise would have been without Equiano and that the cable would indirectly generate roughly 1.6 million new jobs between 2022 and 2025. “We are partnering with multiple key telecom players, including our landing party, the West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), where Equiano lands to ensure that the cable can reach more businesses and end-users across Nigeria and the African continent more broadly,” she stated.
