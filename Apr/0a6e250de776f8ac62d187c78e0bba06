Members of the Nigerian business community pushing for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 have raised N97 million to buy the All Progressives Congress (APC) nomination form for him. They also charged him to formally declare for the 2023 presidential race without further delay. The VP supporters under the auspices of Businessmen for Osinbajo (BFO) said Nigerians who want the vice president to lead the country in the next dispensation have increased by millions across the country. The group said the VP’s supporters were running out of patience and wanted him to make his declaration known. In a statement signed by its convener, Dr. Tayo Fashogbon, the group said it has budgeted N97 million to buy nomination form for the vice president, saying it was ready to canvass and mobilise delegates for the presidential primary in favour of Osinbajo and subsequently a minimum of eight million voters from the grassroots in the presidential election. Fashogbon said the group wants Osinbajo to accept the offer to serve and rescue Nigeria at this crucial moment. He said, “Because of his track records with President Muhammadu Buhari, even in his short stint as the acting president, we are therefore calling on the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) to avail himself to be of service to the country he has committed so much to. “We are also calling on President Buhari, who has done so much in the last seven years despite the meagre resources at his disposal as a result of the global shortfall in the price of crude oil, to throw his support behind the candidature of the Vice President should he accept to vie for the office of president,” he said. According to Fashogbon, “We are ready to mobilise no less than eight million Nigerians towards the 2023 polls for this divine mandate and we are saying this with all sense of responsibility.”
