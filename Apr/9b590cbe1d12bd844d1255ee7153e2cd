A bullion van belonging to a yet-to-be identified bank was on Thursday afternoon attacked by gunmen along the Ogbor-Nguru – Nwankwo in the Aboh Mbaise local government area of Imo State.  Eyewitness said the driver, who had delivered cash to Mbaise, was returning to Owerri before he was ambushed by the gunmen who had given him a hot chase.  A journalist, Kennedy Onwunali, who witnessed the incident, said the locals took to their heels following the heavy gunfire that ensued.  “In a bid to rob the van, the robbers ambushed the driver, such that the vehicle somersaulted and crashed into other parked vehicles. It is a miracle he didn’t die,” he said.  Onwunali said the incident occurred around the popular General Hospital, Ogbor-Nguru at about 1:30pm on Thursday.  The robbers allegedly fired several shots at the van from Ahiara junction all in a bid to intercept the vehicle but the vehicle finally samasaulted at the General Hospital, Ogbor-Nguru.  It was learnt that the bullion van had already been emptied and was heading back when it was attacked.  One Mr Uche said the gunmen gave the driver a hot chase before he caved in.  However, the Police spokesperson in the state, Michael Abattam, said there was a robbery attack but maintained the van was empty at the time of the incident as the money had been delivered and the van was returning to Owerri, the state capital.  Abattam said: “Sketchy information revealed that the bullion van was returning after delivering money and was attacked by hoodlums. The driver on noticing it, tried to escape. Unfortunately, his vehicle capsized.  No money was carted away please,” adding that further details will follow soon.
