Ebonyi State commissioner for Information and State Orientation, Uchenna Orji, yesterday said the presidential ambition of Governor David Umahi had remained unwavering and alive in the hearts of Nigerians. In a statement he signed  and made available to LEADERSHIP in Abakaliki, the state capital,  Orji described as mischievous, some publications on social media alleging that Governor Umahi had dropped his presidential ambition for senatorial position. Orji said contrary to the fabrications, the state government restated that the falsehood trending currently in social media was nothing but empty and vaunting architecture of political charlatans. He noted that those spreading the falsehood were those intimidated by the tall and admirable hallmarks of leadership excellence recorded by Governor Umahi which had put him forward as a frontline presidential material that could win the hearts of Nigerians in the 2023 general election. “Governor Umahi’s presidential ambition is unwavering and is alive in the hearts of Nigerians”. “We advise the opposition forces and their agents to desist from all these fruitless and bizarre orchestrations against God’s servant and accomplished leader, for that is bringing more ostracism to their own organisms. “We assure them that no matter the secrecy and potency of their plots, God will bring it to naught as we come in the name of God,” Orji said. The commissioner also said they would not hesitate to expose the identities of the paid jobbers and their principals who had taken to social media to escalate fake news and false information aimed at undermining the presidential ambition of Governor Umahi.
