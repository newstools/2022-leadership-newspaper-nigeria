Former deputy national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olabode George, has called on the national chairman of the party, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, to call members of the Lagos State executive of the party to order over administrative fees the state executive is charging aspirants vying for various offices in the forthcoming general elections. George, a member Board of Trustees of the PDP, who said the levy was illegal, threatened that if the party executive in the state should go ahead to charge the money he would petition the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC). The  Lagos State Working Committee of the party in a memo  dated 19th April,  2022 and  sent to all aspirants signed by the State Publicity Secretary of the party, Hakeem Amode, stated that the state assembly aspirants should pay an administrative fee of N50,000 to the state financial secretary. The memo also directed that the sum of N200,000,  N350,000 and  N500,000 be paid by House of Representatives aspirants, senatorial aspirants and governorship aspirants respectfully as an administrative fee. George in a statement he signed yesterday warned the aspirants to ignore such directives, saying such  ‘administrative charge’ is unknown to the PDP constitution and therefore it is illegal. He said all the states chapters would get a certain percentage of the money already paid to the national body of the party, hence there was no need to further charge the aspirants any fees.
