A former Vice Chancellor of Abia State University, Uturu, and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2023 governorship aspirant, Prof. Uche Ikonne, has said that he has something extra to offer than the other aspirants. Ikonne, who stated this at the weekend while declaring his aspiration for the office of Abia State governor in Umuahia, the state capital, said the extra things are his virtues, which include experience, commitment, maturity, and excellence. He said the virtues were gathered through his discipleship of notable past leaders of the state both in the academics and the society as well as his headship of the State University and Polytechnic. According to the Ukwa La Ngwa Nation consensus candidate, he was coming to build on the foundation laid by the present administration of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, adding that Abia would witness massive infrastructure development if elected as governor. Ikonne, who argued that at a time like this when competition for the office has become stronger, he noted that it would need a candidate like him to fly the party’s flag to scale through, even as he appealed to PDP members to give him the opportunity. In his response, Abia State PDP chairman, Rt. Hon. Alwell Asiforo Okere, said with Ikonne’s governorship declaration, the party has been witnessing quality aspirants in the race, describing it as a welcome development. He restated the ruling party’s commitment and resolution to provide a level playing ground for the aspirants to ensure the emergence of the best in view of the enormity of the battle.
