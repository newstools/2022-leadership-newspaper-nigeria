Idoniboye, who gave the piece of advice while preaching a sermon in Port Harcourt yesterday, said it will not be wise for Christians to pray for the success of the election but fail to come out on election day to perform their civic duty. He said, “You look at the capabilities of the person. You don’t choose because of the party; I like the Peoples Democratic Party or I like All Progressives Congress. No. “If we must get it right as a people, we must come to a place where we assess individuals. We are in a transition phase and people are running around right now, talking about votes. “Transition phase is one of the toughest phases to manage. I just like him, he is tall. No! Vote for someone who can invest in the future. “I want to challenge you, don’t sell your votes. As a Christian, you have been praying and praying but on Election Day, you will not go and vote and you think that God will now plant a leader. No!”
