Analysts said the dominance of the bears would continue on the equity segment of the Nigerian Exchange (NGX), pending any significant economic developments. Analysts at Cordros Securities Limited said, “With the moderation in the prices of bellwether stocks this week, we expect savvy investors to take advantage of this and make re-entry ahead of first quarter 2022 earnings announcements. Considering that the 2021 full year earnings season has run its course, we now expect investors’ sentiment to be influenced by developments in the macroeconomic landscape and the movement of yields in the fixed income space. Overall, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally sound stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” In the new week, Cowry Asset Management Limited expects equities to trade sideways as investors stay on the sidelines in anticipation of first quarter corporate financial results. On market outlook, the chief operating officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Mr Ambrose Omordion said: “we expect a mixed sentiment on bargain hunting as players digest the 2021 audited financials to reposition for Q1, 2022 earnings expectation. “This is expected to support an uptrend during this earnings season, amidst the oscillating oil prices, just as the market continues to interpret economic data in relationship with the crude oil price and other factors, in the midst of profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing.” Last Week’s Trading The bears continued to dictate proceedings in the local bourse as the market suffered its fourth consecutive weekly loss last week.
