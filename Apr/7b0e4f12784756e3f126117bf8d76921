The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja II yesterday admonished those vying for various political positions in the country to see such leadership positions as that of a steward because it is meant to serve the common people. The Ooni stated this at his palace, in Ile-Ife while playing host to the minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, who paid the monarch a courtesy visit to intimate him of his bid to be the next president of Nigeria. The monarch described the minister as one of the luckiest politicians in the country, noting that Nigerians have a lot to gain from his wealth of experience. “You have been relevant since the start of this Republic, it is for a reason and I urge you to use that grace for the betterment of all Nigerians. “What is obvious in your team is the inclusion of women, I am proud of this and I want you to keep doing more in this regard. Women are so powerful especially when given leadership opportunities, they see what we men do not see.” Ooni Ogunwusi said. Earlier, Amaechi who lauded the Ooni for preserving and upholding the prestigious Yoruba culture explained that the country has a lot to benefit from the traditional institution, saying he decided to start his consultation and visitation from Ile-Ife because the ancient city is the source. “If elected as Nigeria’s president in 2023, I will sit down with the National Assembly to address the relevance of the traditional institution in Nigeria. There is a need to consult our traditional rulers in order to bring governance closer to the people,” he said. Amaechi, who described himself as the bridge between the young and old generations in the country, added that he is the most qualified.
