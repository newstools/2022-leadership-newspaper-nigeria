British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has again apologised for breaking COVID-19 lockdown laws in his first address to Parliament since being fined by police. Johnson apologised to MPs over Downing Street parties. He said people had a right to expect better of their prime minister over his No 10 party fine. He said he apologised “unreservedly” and respected the outcome of the police investigation. The PM said he know so many people would be “angry and disappointed” but he was “obligated to deliver on the priorities of the British people”. Meanwhile Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis compared the prime minister’s COVID-19 party fine to other politicians receiving a speeding ticket, while speaking to Mishal Husain on Radio 4’s Today programme. The comment comes ahead of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s first appearance in parliament since he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer were fined for attending parties while coronavirus lockdown rules were in place.
