The leadership of the Southeast zone of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has vowed not to allow the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)  to take back Ebonyi State. The party also disclosed that its target in the 2023 general election is to win all states in the Southeast, starting from Abia and Enugu states. Addressing journalists at the end of the party’s inaugural zonal meeting yesterday in Enugu, the national vice chairman (Southeast) of the party, Dr  Ijeomah Arodiogbu, expressed satisfaction with the judgement by the Appeal Court sitting in Enugu which dismissed the suit filed to remove Ebonyi State governor Dave Umahi. The suit was filed by the candidate of the APC in the 2019 governorship election, Sonni Ogbuoji and his deputy, Justin Ogbodo Mbam, demanding that the court declare the seats of Umahi and his deputy, Kelechi Igwe vacant on account of their defection from the PDP to the APC. But, in a unanimous judgment delivered by Justice J. O. K. Oyewole on Friday, the court held that the appellants had no locus standi in their bid to supplant the respondents. Arodiogbu said the party was happy with the outcome of the judgement and that  it was part of its responsibility to defend all the states under the party’s control in the region. “Ebonyi is one of such states and we cannot let people come in through the back door and harass the governor,” Arodiogbu said. Arodiogbu maintained that the zonal office of the party has a target in the 2023 election which is to win all states in the Southeast, adding that the goal cannot be achieved without the support of the people. He called on residents in the Southeast to continue to support the party, particularly in the coming elections in order to attract more infrastructural development.
