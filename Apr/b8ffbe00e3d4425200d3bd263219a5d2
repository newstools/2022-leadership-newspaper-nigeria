Former senate president, Dr Bukola Saraki said contrary to media reports, he has not stepped down his ambition of seeking to provide effective and efficient leadership for the country in 2023. The former two term governor of Kwara State said he cannot be distracted in his quest to win the election to restore Nigeria to its position of fame, integrity and glory. He said he was very much in the race and would soon make an open declaration to the nation. Saraki spoke through the chairman of his national campaign council, Prof Iorwuese Hagher on insinuations that he had stepped down from the race. In a statement in Abuja, Saraki urged the media to report facts and not mindsets or imaginary thoughts for cheap political gains. According to him, Saraki is one of the presidential aspirants moving round the country to seek support and reveal his blueprint to the nation and has not contemplated backing out of the race.
