Over 220 exhibitors from 40 countries and 5,000 visitors are expected to feature at the forthcoming Food and Beverage (FAB) West Africa 2022 show in Lagos. The three-day, which is slated for between June 14 and June 16, 2022 in Lagos, will parade state-of-the-art technologies and innovations in the agricultural value chain. The show, which is being organised by BtoB Events, is sponsored by Just Food and NASCO Group. In a statement issued by BtoB Events managing director, Jamie Hill, which was made available to LEADERSHIP in Abuja, he said, “After the huge success of FAB West Africa 2021, I cannot wait to bring the largest edition of the Food and Beverage West Africa exhibition back to Nigeria. “This year’s exhibition has seen an incredible increase in demand for exhibition space and will host exhibitors from across 40 countries and five continents. The previous edition back in September 2021 was a huge success, despite certain COVID-19 and travel restrictions. “For 2022, and the first edition since international travel was relaxed, we have seen a surge in demand for exhibition space,” he said.
