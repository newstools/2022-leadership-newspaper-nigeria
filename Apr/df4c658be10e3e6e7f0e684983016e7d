Minister of Science Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, has debunked a media report claiming that he sees himself as the presidential flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC), ahead of the 2023 general elections, describing the report as the handiwork of political jobbers. The minister, in a statement yesterday, by the deputy director of Press and Public Relations of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Afonja Ajibola, further urged the public to ignore the said report. The statement read in part: “The attention of the Honourable Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu has been drawn to a report by some political destabilisers, who are bent on destroying the personality of the Minister and the APC in order to derail the progress being made in the STI ecosystem in the country. “To get the facts straight, Dr. Onu has not at any time made the statement credited to him by the political jobbers in the said publication. Rather Dr. Onu in his loyal and committed nature is presently focused on the development of a Knowledge driven and Innovation centred economy required to move Nigeria into the Fourth Industrial Revolution. “Members of the Nigerian public at home and in the Diaspora should ignore this false publication.”
