Ahead of the Sallah celebrations, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) Abuja operations office, and the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), have deployed their personnel on roads leading into and out of Abuja, the nation’s capital. The deployment, which was part of the Easter deployment, is billed to cover the Sallah period starting from this weekend. The programme was flagged off on April 14, 2022 with the theme, “Achieving Zero Road Fatality, Through Public Enlightenment” was unveiled by FRSC, being the lead agency in management of road crashes. Speaking at the event, NEMA’s head of Abuja operations office, Justin Uwazuruonye, said this was done to ensure the smooth flow of traffic during the festive seasons and complement the efforts of FRSC. According to him, “This programme will continue during the Sallah celebrations as the volume of traffic is always high and people are mostly not careful on the roads during festive periods,” he had said. Some other critical partners in the programme include the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, (NSCDC), Nigeria Police Force (NPF), Vehicle Inspection Office (VIO), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and officials of National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), amongst others. The personnel were deployed at Giri – Gwagwalada, Zuba and Airport Roads, including Nyanya-Kugbo down to Mararaba Road. Some of the equipment deployed include Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) Ambulances for life support, Rapid Response Van with extricating equipment and experienced personnel.
