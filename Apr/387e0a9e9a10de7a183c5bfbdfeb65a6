The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has imposed a penalty of N400 on deposit money banks (DMBs) for every mutilated N100 sent to the apex bank. The penalty took effect from April 1. The CBN, in a circular issued by the director, Currency Operations Department, Ahmed Umar, warned DMBs to stop bringing “composed banknotes ” as part of their deposits with the apex bank. Composed banknotes are mutilated currency notes comprising several parts of different banknotes of the same denomination. The parts of such currency notes are usually put together with the intention of receiving value. Umar said that the existence of such banknotes in the economy falsified the true value of currency in circulation, and could also be avenue for fraudulent activities. He said that henceforth, composed banknotes discovered in the deposit of DMBs shall attract a penalty of 400 per cent of the value. “The management of the CBN observed with concern the increase number of composed banknotes deposited by DMBs and request for replacement of such banknotes by members of the public. “The existence of composed banknotes in the economy falsify the true value of currency in circulation, and can also be avenue for fraudulent activities. “Consequently, any composed banknote discovered in the deposit of DMBs shall attract penalty of 400 per cent of the value,” he said.
