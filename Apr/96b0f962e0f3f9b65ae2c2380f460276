Leke, who is also a Pastor under the RCCG, on Wednesday, had insulted pastors who chose to preach during Thanksgiving Service instead of connecting to the church headquarters for the joint programme and listen to the GO message. LEADERAHIP learnt that Leke was made to face a three-man panel by the church on Wednesday, April 6, 2022 over his statement. In a statement, titled; “My Sincere Apology” posted on his Instagram page on Thursday, April 7, 2022, Leke said: “I wish to use this medium to tender my unreserved apologies on the statement made from my social media handle about some of our esteemed pastors. “The disciplinary measures taken by the mission is well received and this period will be used to reflect and introspect. “I wish to crave the indulgence to please forgive my extreme statement which I wish to emphasise was absolutely not intended to insult or malign. “I also wish to apologise profusely to the entire leadership and Pastors of our beloved Church who might have been hurt by this statement. “I remain humbly yours in God’s love and mercies. Yours in His service.”
