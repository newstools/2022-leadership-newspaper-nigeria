A former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has picked the nomination and expression of interest forms of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) to contest the presidency in 2023. Kwankwanso, who paid N30million for the forms, called on Nigerians especially politicians who truly want to change the country for good to join NNPP. Speaking at the national headquarters of the NNPP while collecting the forms, Kwankwanso said his party will take over presidential power in 2023. “This is a progressive party that want to change the political landscape of this country. If you go to any ward now, the party people are talking about now is NNPP. Those who want to grow this country should join NNPP,” Kwankwanso said. The former minister of defence added: “This country have never been divided like this before and we are people who want to unite this country regardless of religion and tribe because the country is for all of us.” Speaking further, he said: “Let me at this point also, invite all Nigerians to register in NNPP. Go to your wards and register. We have been printing membership cards and they are being exhausted. “For people who want to join politics, come and buy the forms at the headquarters of the NNPP. For the State House of Assembly forms are at the state level.”
