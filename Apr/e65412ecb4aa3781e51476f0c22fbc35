After we had gone the entire length of the government area, a government official came out to address us. Like we guessed, he mentioned the war in Ukraine after complimenting us for our orderliness in passing across the message despite our anger. “I assure you that it is something we are working on. We feel your anger and frustration. And we know it has not been easy, but please rest assured that we will resolve the fuel crisis.” He spoke eloquently and everyone listened. After his speech, Altine’s hand shot up, and he nodded in her direction, “Yes young lady?” Altine shouted above the noise, “Sir, is this scarcity a means to remove fuel subsidy?!” The man paused for a second as if to digest the implication of what she had just said, then laughed at the question and shook his head. He went on to dismiss her question, saying it was not the case. He casually reiterated the government’s commitment to resolve the matter before taking his leave.
