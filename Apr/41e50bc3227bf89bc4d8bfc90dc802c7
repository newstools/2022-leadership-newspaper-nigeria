A House of Representatives aspirant for Asa/Ilorin West Federal Constituency on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Kwara State, Alh Ibrahim Ajia, has urged the leadership of the party  in the state to embark on mass mobilisation and woo aggrieved individuals back into the party. He said the success of the PDP in the forthcoming general elections is  crucial for effective and efficient representation at all levels of governance. Ajia spoke in Ilorin, the state capital during an iftar he hosted in honour of PDP chairmen in Ilorin and Asa local government areas of the state. Ajia enjoined the ward party leaders to persuade those who left the PDP on account of some grievances to return, assuring that their problems would be addressed. He pleaded with the aggrieved members to sheath their swords and work for the success of the party, maintaining that the opposition party cannot afford to fail in the coming polls. He solicited the support of the ward chairmen for his ambition, promising to leverage on his relationship and vast network to attract development to the constituency. “We have a major task before us as a party and we cannot afford to fail our constituents, who are yearning for responsible representation. It is crucial that we take advantage of the forthcoming  general elections to win the confidence of our people back and give them better representation,” he added.
