The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday screened all the 17 presidential aspirants. The nine-member screening committee led by former senate president, David Mark, met with all the aspirants at the Legacy House which is used by the party as its presidential campaign office. The process which commenced by 11am, ended at 5pm. Two aspirants were disqualified by the committee. Mark, who disclosed this to newsmen after the screening process, refused to divulge the names of the disqualified aspirants. He also refused to state the reasons why they were disqualified. The screening procedure included checking for their academic qualifications, tax returns; voter’s card, financial capacity; party membership; and proof of nationality. The aspirants screened by the committee were former vice president, Atiku Abubakar; Sokoto State governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal; immediate past president of the senate, Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki and former secretary to the government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim. Also screened were Bauchi State governor, Senator Bala Mohammed; Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike; Akwa Ibom State governor, Udom Emmanuel; 2019 PDP vice presidential candidate and former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi; former Ekiti State governor, Ayodele Fayose; a United States-based medical doctor; Nwachukwu Anakwenze and media mogul, Dele Momodu. Others were investment banker and economist, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen; a pharmacist, Sam Ohuabunwa; former speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly, Cosmos Ndukwe; Charles Ugwu, Rt Hon Chikwendu Kalu as well as the only female aspirant in the race, Tareila Diana. Speaking on the outcome the exercise, Mark, who said it went well, added; “We’ve been very thorough this time around. See how much time we’ve taken to screen each individual. We screened 17 aspirants, which is quite a number. We cleared 15, two have not been cleared. “Now don’t ask me those who have been cleared and those who have not been cleared because I won’t tell you. We haven’t released the result to them. So if you ask question in that direction, you’re wasting time. I think on the whole that’s what we’ve done. And we’re quite satisfied with the standard of the aspirants by and large. And we think that any one of them who gets the ticket would win the election in 2023.” On what the committee found wrong with disqualified aspirants, he said; “They didn’t meet the requirements.” When pressed to be specific, he said, “No, I can’t be.” He said the committee would send the report to the National Working Committee (NWC) yesterday night. He added; “We’ll submit and then those who were not cleared have a right to appeal. I’m sure they will go on appeal because there is an appeal panel.” On the panel’s impression of the aspirants, he said; “We feel they all very well qualified, those we’ve cleared. And that like I just said anyone of them who is picked will win the 2023 presidential election.” On refund of the funds, he said, “Why should they refund the money? What will be the reason now?” However, the thorny issue of how the zones it’s presidential ticket came to the fore as some aspirants differed on the how it should be handled. While Governor Emmanuel and Obi stated that the party’s decision on the matter was supreme, Fayose maintained that the party must take a position on zoning. <img class="wp-image-375743 alignleft" src="//i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220429-WA0009.jpg?resize=493%2C370&#038;ssl=1" alt="pdp" width="493" height="370" srcset="//i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220429-WA0009.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220429-WA0009.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220429-WA0009.jpg?resize=750%2C563&amp;ssl=1 750w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220429-WA0009.jpg?resize=1140%2C855&amp;ssl=1 1140w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220429-WA0009.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px" data-recalc-dims="1"> On zoning, Fayose said, “Well, I say it again, very expressly, that I am for zoning and I believe the best thing this party can do for posterity, for tomorrow, so as not to cause confusion is for this party to zone this presidential campaign or presidential election. You know why, If we fail to do it, even if we say anybody can contest, you must officially zone it to the South.” However, Emmanuel said, “The party is supreme, if the party has spoken we will all abide by what the party has said.” On his part, Obi said, “The party has the final say. I can’t have a thought, I’m a member of a party. If the party says this is where they want to go, if you’re a member of an organisation, you respect that organisation. And that is why I said, whatever we do, the most critical thing is, what we do to pull Nigerians out of poverty and create a future for teeming unemployed youths in Nigeria.” Obi described the screening process as normal and well organised, adding that the committee went through documents they were supposed to present. He added that his chance of emerging candidate was left to the delegates to decide. On his part, Anyim said the process was smooth, adding that the screening was not meant to disqualify anyone. Governor Mohammed reiterated that he would step down his ambition the moment former president, Goodluck Jonathan, picks the ticket of any political party. The governor who served in Jonathan’s administration as minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), said, “I respect Jonathan so much and I know up to this moment, he has not declared, he is not here. And declaration is not the assumption or assumption of the ticket of the party. But certainly if you collect the ticket of any other party, I will not be joining issues with him.”  PDP Concludes Screening Of South-South Guber Aspirants The Screening Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday concluded the screening of governorship aspirants from the South-South geopolitical zone of the country in Port Harcourt.
