Ese Brume, Aruna Quadri and six other Nigerian athletes’ journey for podium success at the Paris 2024 Olympics have given a huge boost as they have been captured in the latest International Olympic Committee (IOC) scholarship scheme.

An overjoyed Secretary General of the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC)  Banji Oladapo, said the scholarship was an indication that Team Nigeria’s light at the Paris Olympics could glow brighter than expected. Oladapo noted that the scholarship included access to appropriate training facilities with coaches who specialise in their respective disciplines, regular medical and scientific assistance, accident and illness insurance, pocket money, and travel costs for the athletes’ participation in relevant competitions and qualification events. ‘’We congratulate these eight athletes for earning scholarships as they focus on their qualification for the Paris 2024 Olympics.
