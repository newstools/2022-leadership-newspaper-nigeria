A federal judge in Florida has struck down the Biden administration’s mask mandate for airplanes and other forms of public transit, calling it unlawful. US District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle said the national public health agency had exceeded its legal powers in issuing the mandate. The US transit authority said it would now no longer enforce mask wearing. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) just last week extended the mandate until 3 May. Judge Mizelle is based in Florida, but federal judges can issue rulings that block nationwide government policies. Her order on Monday effectively removes the masking requirement in all airports, trains, taxis and transit hubs. Some social media users reported that the order was announced on aircraft mid-flight, prompting travellers to applaud and remove their masks. On Monday, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants appealed for “calm and consistency” in airports and on planes to avoid “confusion and chaos”. White House press secretary Jen Psaki called the decision “disappointing” and noted that the CDC still recommends travellers cover their mouths and noses. Ms Psaki added that the Justice Department “would make any determinations about litigation” following the order. The CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment to Monday’s ruling. Last week US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said the mandate had been extended into May
