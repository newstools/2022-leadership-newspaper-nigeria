The immediate-past governor of Gombe State, Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo, on Saturday, returned to the state after three years he had stayed away. Dankwambo, who arrived at Gombe, the state capital around 2pm, was received by his teeming supporters, chieftains and members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, who accompanied him from airport to the party’s state secretariat. The former governor while appreciating the party faithful, who trooped out to receive him, donated a cash sum of N6million to party officials in the 11 local government areas of the state. Later in an interview with journalists, Dankwambo said he would spend some days in the state to interact with his people, assess the performance of the state government in the areas of security, projects and human development and thereafter express his views. Our correspondent reports that there were speculations across the state that the former governor is going to vie for the Senatorial seat of Gombe North in 2023, the position he contested and lost to the incumbent Senator Sa’idu Alkali in the last 2019 polls.
