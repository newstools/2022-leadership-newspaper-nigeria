The complainant alleged that, after paying the money, the defendant became evasive and all efforts to get her money back proved abortive. The one-count charge reads: “Isah sometime in 2020 in Kaduna did obtain the total sum of N500,000 (Five Hundred Thousand Naira) only from one Aisha Abdul-Aziz Mohammed under the false pretence that she will secure an employment for her with NBAIS (National Board for Arabic Institute Studies) which she knew to be false and you thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 1(1) (a) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act 2006 and Punishable Under Section 1(3) of the same Act.” She, however. pleaded not guilty to the charge when it was read to her. Prosecuting Counsel, E.K Garba, urged the court to remand the defendant and fix a date for commencement of trial.
