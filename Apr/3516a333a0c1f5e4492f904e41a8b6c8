Federal government yesterday received a total of 3,002,400 doses of Johnson and Johnson (J&J) from the Italy. Speaking during the handing over in Abuja, executive director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib, said the roll out of J&J has rapidly improved the country’s coverage. He said the vaccine would be judiciously utilised, as the Agency has instituted accountability in the COVID-19 vaccination programme to ensure efficient use of all available resources. Shuaib reiterated that the country had adequate quantity of COVID-19 vaccines across all states for every eligible person in Nigeria. He, therefore, urge all persons aged 18 years and above including pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers to take advantage of the availability of these vaccines to get vaccinated. “All COVID-19 vaccines in Nigeria are free, safe, effective and protect you, your family and community against COVID-19,” he said. The head of delegation of European Union to Nigeria, Ambassador Samuela Isopi, said the UK’s action against COVID-19 does not stop at its borders. He said as team Europe, the EU and its member states have more than 20 million COVID-19 doses to Nigeria through COVAX.
