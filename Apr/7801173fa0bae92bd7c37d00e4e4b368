The singer, rapper and performer, who is an independent artiste, performed the unannounced 50mins concert as an April Fools Day surprise for his fans. Sammie who said he had earlier planned a Valentine’s Day online concert decided to surprise his fans with the April 1st performance as an April fools day prank. SammieFaze had given details on his Instagram story about the performance earlier in the day but disguised it as an April Fools day prank. It wasn’t until the actual performance began by 12noon that his fans realised he was serious about the live gig and that it wasn’t a prank. This was Sammie’s first ever virtual performance via Instagram live. “In the coming months prior to the release of my sophomore EP I will be having such unannounced performances so I can use the opportunity to play them some tracks from the EP to get their opinion,” he added. “I hopes to use these performances as way of getting feedback on the songs I have lined up for the EP. It will also help me interact directly with my fans so I wil get an idea of the kind of music they will like on my EP,” Sammie further explained. Samuel also revealed he will be announcing a video challenge as promotions for the EP release where several of his top fans will win some cash prizes and other gifts as rewards.I
