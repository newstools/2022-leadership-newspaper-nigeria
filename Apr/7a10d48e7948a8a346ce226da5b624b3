President Muhammadu Buhari Friday at State House, Abuja, presented the party’s flag to Mr Abiodun Oyebanji, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Ekiti State gubernatorial election, scheduled for June 18, 2022. “You have served Ekiti State in many capacities, including as Chief of Staff, Commissioner, and Secretary to the State Government. Being Governor will just be continuity of service. I honestly wish you the best of luck,” President Buhari said. According to a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, the candidate was led to the President by national chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the national secretary, Senator Iyiola Omisore, and Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State. The national chairman said APC was planning to win the contest, “by the grace of God,” adding that it was the reason the candidate was being presented for presidential blessings. Governor Fayemi said Oyebanji had been involved in governance in Ekiti in the past 20 years, and has acquainted himself creditably. Speaking to State House correspondents after the meeting, the party chairman said the party came to present their candidate after a  very thorough, transparent primaries, for the President’s blessing. When asked on fears that the APC may implode after the presidential primaries, he said “Thank you very much. On the issue of your fears, God will not allow that to happen to us. We will come out, by the grace of God, at the appropriate time, the candidate at the convention for our great party will choose. “I do not want to speculate, but my duty as chairman is to listen to party men, party leaders, stakeholders, to see what is going to be best when the time comes and I’ve always found it easier and more noble to get a bridge before I jump to cross it. We are not yet there.
