The Movement for the Survival of Izon Ethnic Nationality in the Niger Delta (MOSIEND), has called on the sole administrator of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Effiong Akwa, to obey the judgement of a Federal High Court and vacate his office at the NDDC headquarters in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. Recall that a Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, had a fortnight ago, declared the office of sole administrator illegal and ordered the return of the NDDC supervisory role from the Ministry of the Niger Delta Affairs to the Presidency. Addressing journalists in Port Harcourt on Thursday, MOSIEND President, Ambassador Kennedy Tonjo West, also called on the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, to ensure that the Court judgement is obeyed. West warned that there would be reprisal response in consonance with the judgement of the Federal High Court if Akwa refuse to vacate the NDDC headquarters. He said: “We also want to commend very greatly, the judgement of the Federal High Court, Yenagoa, which instructed the Attorney-General of the Federation to ensure that the NDDC supervision is returned to status quo by going back under the Presidency. “And ensure that the sole administrator, Barrister Akwa’s illegal job is brought to an end and ensure that the NDDC Board is immediately constituted to perform optimally and in the best position of the region. “We are using this medium to instruct and urge Barrister Akwa to steer clear from the NDDC office. Else, there will be reprisal response in consonance with the judgement of the Federal High Court in Bayelsa State. “Let the Attorney-General of the Federation, Malami, immediately ensure that every activity of the sole administrator in NDDC is considered illegal.”
