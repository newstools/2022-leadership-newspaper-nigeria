Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church formerly known as Latter Rain Assembly, Pastor Tunde Bakare, yesterday declared his intention to run for president in the 2023 general election. The preacher who said this at the virtual meeting Unveiling Project 16 to Nigerians in diaspora, with the theme The portrait of a new Nigeria, organised by the PTB4Nigeria in diaspora group maintained that he remained the best suitable candidate to address Nigeria’s problems. The cleric in his address pointed out that ahead of the 2023 general elections, the South was being set against the North, while Christians were set against Muslims. According to him,  he remains the rallying point to restore order in the country, saying he has a vision to build a new Nigeria. “The PTB brand is a rallying point for all Nigerians. I have a vision of a new Nigeria and I will play a leading role as we approach the Nigeria of our dreams, ” Bakare said. It would be recalled that as the presidential candidate of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change, (CPC) President Muhammadu Buhari picked Pastor Tunde Bakare as his running mate for the 2011 presidential election.
