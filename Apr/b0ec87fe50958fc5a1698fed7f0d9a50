With a significant number of the Nigerian population still at the risk of disconnection, the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) on Saturday, announced the commencement of weekend National Identification Number (NIN) registration at all NIN enrollment centres nationwide. As at December 2021, about 71 million Nigerians had enrolled for NIN. Meanwhile, the regulator has extended the deadline of  NIN registration on several occasions from January 2021 to February, June, July, October, December 2021, March 2022 and finally to few days. In a press statement, made available to LEADERSHIP, NIMC disclosed that the weekend enrollment will enable those yet to obtain their NIN to do so within the timeframe given by the federal government before enforcement of NIN-SIM linkage commences.
