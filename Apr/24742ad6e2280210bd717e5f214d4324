The African Democratic Congress (ADC) has criticised the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for commercialising the  democratic system through the imposition of prohibitive and outrageous Expression Of Interest Fees for candidates seeking elective positions. The party is particularly worried that the APC’s N40 million collection of Expression of Interest Forms for its presidential contenders had completely shut the door against resourceful, visionary and vibrant youths but who are bereft of the necessary financial capacity to join the 2023 presidential race. To remedy the situation, Chief Ralphs Okey Nwosu, the national chairman of the party, yesterday told newsmen in Owerri that the party had resolved to offer free forms to youths in the country wishing to run for elective offices under its platform. The measure he said, became necessary to further arouse political consciousness among youths, encourage and motivate them to participate in active partisan politics in the country. Nwosu who spoke at the party’s Global Campus, Okigwe Road (Ugwu Orji) Owerri, shortly after the conduct of the Imo State congress which ushered in new executive of the party, said as the nationally acclaimed credible alternative, the ADC had already taken a critical appraisal of the challenges holding the nation down. According to him, the challenges include;  insurgency, decayed and dilapidated infrastructure, poverty, starvation, hunger  unemployment unprecedented inflation and had adopted result – oriented measures to remedy the said situation if elected into office next year. “With an ADC led administration, we will fix the nation’s wobbling comatose economy and make it the fastest growing economy in Africa”. Nwosu said the ADC with its progressive grassroots mobilisation would hopefully take over power in almost all states of the federation as well as the presidential villa next year. State chairman of the party, Ignatius Nlem,  said since 1999, the nation’s democratic experiment had been unfortunate in the production of her political leadership with no resolute political will by successive leaderships to take the people to the next level.
