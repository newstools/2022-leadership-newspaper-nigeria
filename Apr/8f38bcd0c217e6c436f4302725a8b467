A frontiline politician in Rivers State, Prince Tonye Princewill, has expressed the hope that the Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, will build on the foundations already laid by President Muhammadu Buhari if elected as the next president of the country come 2023. Amaechi, who is a former Rivers State governor, had on Saturday, declared his intention to contest for the Presidency on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Speaking with journalists in Port Harcourt on Saturday, Princewill said Amaechi has the capacity and energy to turn things around if elected to succeed Buhari in 2023. He said: “I am happy; I am graceful. I think it is justice because some of us have been arguing about this for a long time. He needs to run for the President because the state, the country, the region needs him. “So, I am grateful and happy and I know that this is the beginning of the work. Nobody should think that it is going to be easy, no. It is not going to be easy because a lot of work has to be done. “Amaechi has the capacity. Look at the way he ran round the stadium to greet people. That shows you the energy in the man. With that kind of energy, you follow things bumper to bumper, to make sure that what is supposed to be done is done. “Amaechi said he was not running because of his personal ambition but he is running because of the fact that he knows that he has a sense of responsibility and duty to perform. “Nigerians should expect results. People can lay foundation and that is what Buhari did. If somebody lays the foundation, you may not appreciate the building but Amaechi is coming to put to finishing touches to it. “It is impossible for somebody to lay a foundation and put up a skyscraper within one tenure or two tenures, it takes time. That’s what you are seeing happening now.”
