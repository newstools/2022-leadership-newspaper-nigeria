Operatives of the Nigeria Police Force have arrested at least 98 scavengers popularly known as ‘Baban Bola’ over alleged stealing of residents’ properties in Abuja. Parading the suspects on Monday at the FCT command’s headquarters, the deputy police commissioner, DCP Ben Igwe, said Abuja is not for everybody as the police would deport the suspects to their states of origin. He said some strange persons have been trooping into the nation’s capital, stating that the command was working towards eradicating such personalities from Abuja. He said, “Abuja is not for everybody. We have asked them to go to where they are supposed to be. “We are working towards clearing them from the FCT. We will keep doing that and we will not relent. “We recovered from them several things that they are not supposed to scavenge. They steal properties while claiming to scavenge refuses. “We have asked them to relocate. Many people have been trooping into the FCT. And some of them are coming with evil intentions. Whenever you see them, let us know. “We are taking them to court to make sure that justice is given. We have a serious issue now because of threats from so many places.”
