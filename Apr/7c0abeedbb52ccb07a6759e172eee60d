Members of all branches of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in Ondo State on Thursday protested against what they called the interference of the state government in the affairs of the state council of the union. The union members who trooped out in their large numbers protested the alleged plan by the state government to impose the immediate past chairman of the union, Jacob Adebo(a.k.a Idajo), for a second term. The protesting drivers who converged on Owo, Owo local government area of the state, disclosed that there was a ploy by some individuals in the corridor of power in the state to use the state machinery to proscribe the union if members of the union refused the imposition of the immediate past chairman. The union, however, advised the state government to allow the constitution of the union which prescribed election to take its full course. Speaking on behalf of the Union, Comrade Gbenga Ijalade, who appealed to members of the union to be peaceful, said, “We won’t fight if they prescribe our union, we won’t fight, but we will wait till election season when we will choose the candidate that will not punish us.” According to him, “They have threatened us that if we do not allow them to impose Jacob Adebo on us they will proscribe our union. “Idajo has one vote among over 5000 drivers in our state. The majority decides, but they want to impose. From our work, we send our children to school. We will adhere strictly to the court judgement. We have resolved not to withdraw the case from the court.” Ijalade stated that the protest became necessary to draw the attention of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to the imposition and proscription plan by certain individuals in his administration.
