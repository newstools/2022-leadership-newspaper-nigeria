The Nigerian Army (NA) has reacted to the viral video of a Soldier claiming to have been abandoned by his colleagues at a war front, saying the video was a calculated attempt to whip up sentiments. The Director, Army Public Relations, Brig. Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, stated this while reacting to the viral video on the social media, where a soldier on Wednesday, March 30, 2022 claimed to have been abandoned by his colleagues during operations. He said contrary to the claims by the soldier in the video footage, “preliminary investigations have revealed that the video footage was a deliberate attempt to shield himself from being accused of cowardice, having abandoned his colleagues during an ongoing clearance operation in Gurara, Niger State.” He recalled that troops of the NA recently carried out a clearance operation in Gurara local government area of Niger State. “Disappointingly, during an encounter, the said soldier abandoned his colleagues and absconded in an outright display of cowardice and possible sabotage, which negate the precepts of the military profession. “Sensing the gravity of his action and its consequences, the soldier surreptitiously uploaded the video online in a calculated attempt to whip-up public sentiment and cover up his act of cowardice. “The soldier’s action amounts to a betrayal of the esprit de corps and comradery that are synonymous with a military unit and fighting formation, particularly during operations,” the Army spokesman said. He added that the soldier’s conduct was, therefore, an aberration and against the ethics and core values of the military profession. “The video footage is thus, in all intent, and purpose a misrepresentation of what actually transpired between the soldier and his colleagues,” he stated. Brig. Gen. Nwachukwu stated that soldier has rejoined his unit, adding that further investigations were ongoing to unravel the reasons behind his unprofessional conduct.
