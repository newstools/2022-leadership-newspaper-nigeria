Ahead of the 2023 general election, the Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has thrown his weight behind his wife’s senatorial ambition in Imo State. The governor in a statement he signed and made available to LEADERSHIP yesterday said those whose activities have borne a positive impact on the lives of the under-privileged, must be supported by all good people. He said, “Public service is taken as the highest form of participation in the affairs of a human community, state or a country. It ennobles anyone, privileged to serve, whose tenacity, focus and integrity ensure development. Only a few are truly equipped for service. They must be encouraged at all times.” Akeredolu who further stated that the evolution of modern societies bears indelible evidence of significant inputs of few people noted that the trajectory records definitive impacts of those who dare to think and act differently. His words:” Betty, FLOOS, let me choose this great day in our lives, our 41st wedding anniversary to notch up and print my support for your popular and known quest to serve your people in the Senate. “The consequence of this defiance finds expression in a radical departure from the old order, leading to transformation. It yields quality accretions that impact positively on the people in any given space. “The world owes those who dare a debt of gratitude for audacity, tenacity, consistency and focus. These torchbearers withstand the brunt of vilification, contempt, deprivation and even rejection. They remain undaunted until the set goal is achieved. They are rarely praised afterwards. “I join all other well-wishers, admirers, supporters and stakeholders to support, openly and without any reservations or equivocation, my adorable Betty in her bid to continue to serve the people in her State of birth, Imo.’’
