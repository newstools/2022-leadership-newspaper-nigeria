Ahead of the presidential primary election of the opposition African Democratic Congress (ADC), one of the leading presidential aspirants, Chukwuka Monye, has picked the party’s nomination forms to contest for the party’s ticket. A statement released yesterday in Abuja by the ADC’s director of communications and programmes, Barr. Ifenla Oligbinde, said the move by Monye has shown his seriousness to fly the ADC flag in the 2023 polls. Oligbinde said ADC has already made forms free for youths between the ages of 18-35, women and persons with disabilities in line with its mainstreaming policies. “The party’s guideline was released a couple of weeks ago after much deliberation with our National Executive Council (NEC). “ADC has proven its readiness to accommodate capable presidential aspirants through the guidelines. Unlike APC, PDP, SDP and other parties that pegged their presidential forms at jaw breaking amounts, fees for all positions are in line with our mainstreaming policies,” he said. Meanwhile, ADC has commended Monye for taking the bull by the horn and officially activating the process by paying for his forms to secure him the party’s ticket ahead of the general election.
