Two Chibok schoolgirls, who escaped from Boko Haram terrorists after their abduction alongside over 200 other schoolgirls in Chibok, Borno State on April 14, 2014, have bagged Master’s degree.  Joy Bishara and Lydia Pogu will receive master’s degree from Florida’s Southeastern University on Friday.  It could be recalled that on April 14, 2014, 276 pupils of Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, Borno State, were kidnapped by the Boko Haram insurgents.  Joy Bishara and Lydia Pogu were among a few, who were able to escape from the insurgents on the way to captivity. Over 100 of them have not returned till date.  The abductions spawned a worldwide condemnation and a social media campaign using the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls.  Bishara and Pogu escaped and eventually found refuge in the United States.  Southeastern University leaders offered scholarships to the women as they finished high school.  Bishara and Pogu received bachelor’s degree in the fall of 2021.  A release from the institution said Pogu will receive a master’s in Human Services during Friday’s graduation ceremony, and Bishara will receive a master’s degree in Social Work, reports The Ledger based in Lakeland Florida.  She will be the student commencement speaker.  She plans to work for a nonprofit organisation and study for the LSAT so she can eventually enroll in Law sShool, Southeastern said in a news release.  Bishara plans to work in a hospital setting as a social worker after graduation, the release added.
