 Seven passengers in a Benue Links vehicle have been abducted in Kabba-Ayere Road, a border community between Kogi and Ondo States. Last week, six Benue indigenes who were travelling to Lagos in a Benue Links bus were abducted in Ochada in Anyigba also in Kogi State. The wife of one of the abductees, Mrs Hanna Orhena, told LEADERSHIP Friday that her husband Pastor Steve Orhena and son Tertsea were kidnapped on Tuesday, 29th March, 2022 at 3 pm in a Benue Links bus enroute Lagos. She said the kidnappers had made contact with her demanding the sum of N5 million for the release of her husband “The abductors called me on Wednesday between 10pm and 11pm and demanded N5 million but I negotiated for N500,000 which they refused and asked me to get someone who could speak Hausa, but my husband and son spoke to me. “They told me that they came from Zamfara and have a boss in Abuja. I only negotiated for my family and I think they are calling everybody’s family for negotiation. My husband is a pastor at Jesus Prophetic and Apostolic Church aka Jesus Family located at North Bank in Makurdi,” she said.
