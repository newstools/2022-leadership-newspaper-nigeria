The Nigerian Textile Manufacturers Association (NTMA) has reacted to the Monday, March 28, 2022 terrorist attack on Abuja-Kaduna train, which happened in Chikun local government area, a few kilometres from the Rigasa train station, Kaduna State, condemning the attack in strong terms. In a statement jointly signed by President of the NTMA, Chief Folorunsho Daniyan, and its Director General, Alhaji Hamma Kwajaffa, on Sunday in Lagos, the textile manufacturers noted that the attack was also a big blow to them being that Kaduna remains the headquarters of textile industry in Nigeria. The Association, therefore, declared its support for President Muhammadu Buhari, the Armed Forces, Nigeria Police Force and the DSS, saying that it was the best that was required of every non-forces person so as to encourage them to do more, especially when it was discovered that the attack was cut short because of the timely response of the policemen attached to the train and quick reinforcement provided by the 1 Division Nigerian Army led by its General Officer Commanding (GOC). Quoting from Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s statement, the NTMA leaders said, “Since government knows where these bandits are, not only in Kaduna or North, but anywhere in Nigeria, they have the military, the police and the intelligence of DSS, these should be concurrently deployed and end this menace of insecurity in the country before it becomes yardstick to measure performance of the government that we know has been doing well.” According to NTMA, “We sympathise with President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Nasir El-Rufai and victims of the terror attack who are currently receiving treatments at various hospitals while praying for the repose of the souls of the dead.”
