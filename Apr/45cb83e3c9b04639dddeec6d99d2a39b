A stalwart of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Gombe State and former political adviser to the immediate past governor of the state Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo, Barrister Babagoro Abdulkadir Yahaya has defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Babagoro in a press release issued to journalists yesterday said that his decision to join the ruling party was in consideration of the unprecedented development projects embarked upon in the state by Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya. He particularly lauded the present administration on new roads projects in the urban and rural areas as well as the various water projects it initiated, adding that the projects will touch the lives of the people of the state positively. The former political adviser who asserted that PDP is no longer viable in the state said he was now interested in Inuwa’s reelection ambition to enable him consolidate on the gains of the first term. “I crossed over to the APC platform to help the governor in his efforts to reposition the state and make it a beacon of hope and envy of others. “It will be recalled that Alhaji Inuwa Yahaya even outside the corridor of power was able to win the governorship election. So, nothing can stop his re-election considering the popular support he is still enjoying,” he asserted.
