The Commissioner of Human Services and Social Development, Hajiya Hafsat Mohammed Baba, has commended the Women’s Rights Advancement and Protective Alternative (WRAPA) for its support in the implementation of the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Law. Hajiya Hasat who disclosed that WRAPA organized a sensitization workshop on the law in Kaduna last week, disclosed that the Civil Society Organisation invited senior government officials, security agencies and members of the civil society to fashion out how VAPP will be really understood. The commissioner said that she and other participants made suggestions that will aid not just the understanding of the law but will help security agencies in the prosecution of offenders. ‘’I suggested that WRAPA should train the wives of all the 23 local government chairmen because most of the violations take place at the grassroots. In addition, Women Development Officers in all the local governments should be trained. ‘’Similarly, Social Workers of the Ministry of Human Services and Social Development in all the 23 local governments should be included in the training module’’, she said. Hajiya Hafsat further pointed out that security agents like the police and personnel of Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps should also undergo the training. The commissioner said that there should be Referral Partnering amongst stakeholders, adding that a Standard Operating Procedure on how and where victims can seek help should be adopted. Hajiya Hafsat who pointed out that Kaduna state has Sexual Referral Centres, further commended WRAPA for championing women issues and campaigning against practices that violate their rights, since its inception over 20 years ago.
