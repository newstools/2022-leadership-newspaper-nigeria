Parents and carers of five to 11-year olds in England can now book a low-dose COVID-19 vaccine for their children. The jabs – already widely used in other countries – can be booked online and will be available from hundreds of sites from Monday. It comes as officials estimate that a record 4.9 million people in the UK have the virus – up from 4.3 million the week before. The figures were released as free tests ended for most people in England. The UK’s vaccine advisers said the jabs would help “future-proof children’s defences” against infections. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland already offer the jabs. In general, most children are not at high risk of becoming severely ill from COVID-19. In February, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said vaccines should go ahead to prevent “a very small number of children from serious illness and hospitalisation” in a future wave of COVID-19 It recommends two doses of the low-dose vaccine, 12 weeks apart, with some five million children now eligible. Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and deputy lead for the NHS COVID-19 vaccination programme, said vaccines remained the best defence against the virus. She added: “My 13-year-old son has had his two vaccinations, and I’ll be booking my 10-year-old daughter in for hers at the earliest opportunity, and would encourage all parents to read the NHS information available and consider doing the same.” Meanwhile, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: “Children without underlying health conditions are at low risk of serious illness from COVID-19, and the priority remains for the NHS to offer vaccines and spring boosters to adults and vulnerable young people, as well as to catch up with other childhood immunisation programmes.” Most appointments will be available at local vaccination centres and community pharmacies. Options for walk-in jabs will also be on offer. Parents and guardians of eligible children will be sent invitations from the NHS in the next few weeks.
