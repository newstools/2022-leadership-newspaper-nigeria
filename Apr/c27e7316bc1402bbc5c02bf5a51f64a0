A Lagos State Magistrates’ Court sitting at Ogba has struck out the money laundering charge filed against the managing director of Shibahwells Energy, Isaac Adewole, and an employee of Wema Bank Plc, Kingsley Ananwude, for lack of merit. Magistrate A.O. Layinka discharged the defendants after the Legal Advice from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), Lagos State stated that no prima facie case had been established against them. The police have arraigned the defendants before the court on February 9, 2022 over allegations of stealing and money laundering involving N1.7billion. The defendants had pleaded not guilty to the charge and the court granted them bail.At the resumed hearing of the matter, Magistrate Layinka discharged the defendants and struck out the charge for lack of Merit after relying on the Legal Advice from the Office of the DPP, Office of the Attorney General of Lagos State/Ministry of Justice. In the legal advice signed by the DPP of Lagos State (a copy of which was sighted by our correspondent), the DPP after an extensive review of the duplicate case file provided by the police authority, stated that the defendants were arrested based on rumours by one Timi Popoola and nothing more. The DPP further stated that there is insufficient evidence to predicate the offences upon which a criminal charge was brought before the Court. Further investigations into the case by our correspondent revealed that the criminal charge of alleged stealing and money laundering involving N1.7 billion and the media hysteria that followed were at the instance of Timi Popoola. It will be recalled that the same Timi Popoola in a similar fashion sometime in February 2021, used the police to settle personal scores with Mr. Ayobami Olubiyi, the chairman of Peace Valley Zone in Magodo G.R.A Phase 2, Lagos.
