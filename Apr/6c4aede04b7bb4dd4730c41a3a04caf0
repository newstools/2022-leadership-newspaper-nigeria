Minister of state for mines and steel development, Dr Uche Ogah, has denied any plan to defect from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). The reports were credited to a chieftain of the opposition party and a 2023 governorship hopeful Chief Chikwe Udensi. LEADERSHIP Sunday reports that Udensi was said to have in a live radio interaction in the state capital, Umuahia said a serving minister from the state was set the join the opposition party soon. Ogah, who was APC’s 2015 and 2019 governorship flag bearer reacted to the rumour in a monitored radio programme in the capital yesterday, adding that he had no such plans. He said: “I have not seen Udensi for the past one year. So, don’t be surprised that some people will come out from rehabilitation centers and be talking what they like.” Maintaining that the APC was not in contention with the APGA for any position, he urged residents of the state to disregard the assertion, saying Udensi may have woken up from a wrong side of his bed. Ogah, who also denied any crisis in the APC in the state, added that whatever challenges the members had been going through would soon be sorted out by its national headquarters. He added: “2023 belongs to the APC in Abia State and we are coming to take over power from the ruling Peoples Democratic Party after 24 years in government.”
