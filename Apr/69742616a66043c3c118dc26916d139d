The federal government restated its commitment toward ensuring total implementation of the policies and plans that will drive sports development. The minister of youth and sports development, Mr Sunday Dare, made the vow, saying two major all-encompassing documents that would further accelerate sports development drive in the country will be ready in time and implemented to the letter. “The National Sports Industry Policy (NSIP) and Football Masterplan Committee will be producing two wholesome documents that will further foster sports development, as well as provide a comprehensive framework to guide sports development in the country,” Dare said. He added that; “We have been able to successfully re-classify sports as a business and this is just a small part of a larger plan. The final draft of the National Sports Industry Policy has been submitted to the Federal Ministry of Justice and we are positive it would change the face of sports in the country. Policies are well-thought, necessitated by a need for direction and wholesome in its approach. So while it may take a lot of time, it would leave a lasting impact.” The Minister further stated that the Committee on Football Masterplan development which was set up to develop football in the country will submit its report in the first week of May, as part of the plans to re-think Nigerian football.
