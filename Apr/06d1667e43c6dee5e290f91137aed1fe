Ononogbu, in a statement made available to journalists in Umuahia, the state capital, on Sunday, noted that the occasion is a period for spiritual rejuvination for Christians. He reminded Christian faithful of the place and importance of the ocassion which marks the crucification and resurrection of Jesus Christ to save mankind from eternal condemnation. “As we reflect on its significance, I urge each and everyone of us to continue to embrace peace, unity, tolerance and understanding with each other as we hope ahead for better days. “For this and more reasons, we should be guided by the lessons, ideals and virtues He stood for. This is the sure way to make meaning out of the supreme sacrifice He made to redeem us,” the party Chairman stated. He, therefore, used the medium to enjoin the party leaders and members in the state to preach the message of compassion, hope, justice, fairness and equity, to all in the spirit of the occasion. “We must continue to build confidence among ourselves and our supporters and to consistently harp on qualitative and committed governance to reposition our party for victory in coming general election,” Ononogbu added. He further urged party faithful to continue to work hard for the unity and development of the party and the state in general just as he assured them of its determination under his leaderdhip to promote their interest and welfare. “APC remains indivisible and the greatest party in Nigeria. We have come to recover the years the locust destroyed. We are very capable of this, and we will do it,” Ononogbu stated.
