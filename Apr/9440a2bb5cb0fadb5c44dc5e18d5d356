The National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA) yesterday disclosed that it has flagged off the “Aggressive Food Production” project in Shendam local government area of Plateau state, targeting 1000 metric tonnes of maize production this wet season. According to NALDA, the projects began with the distribution of inputs to 600 women and youth farmers to cultivate the first phase on 200 hectares of maize farm to boost food security. Speaking on the project while on a visit to the farm, the executive secretary of NALDA, Prince Paul Ikonne explained that the initiative is part of President Muhammadu Buhari’s efforts to ensure that no matter the level of food crises that may arise from the effect of the Russia/Ukraine war, Nigeria would have enough food for her citizens. According to him, NALDA is encouraging farmers with the support of the Central Bank of Nigeria to aggressively produce food by meeting them at their point of need in their localities. He said, “What NALDA is doing at this time is to encourage farmers and individuals to aggressively go into farming in order to achieve food security considering the situation the world would be going into as a result of the Russia/Ukraine war, so these steps we’re taking is to ensure that Nigeria those not experience any form of food shortage or go cap-in-hand looking for food. Prince Ikonne noted that after the wet season harvest, there are plans for NALDA to cultivate wheat in the state. While addressing the beneficiaries from the eight beneficial communities, the NALDA boss said the gesture is to ensure the communities enjoy less stressful ways of farming, engage the youths of the community productively thereby reducing crimes in the community and the society at large. He assured them of NALDA’s continous support all through the farming process through extension services to ensure maximum yields. Prince Ikonne further assured the beneficiaries of market availability as NALDA would be off taking from them during harvest.
