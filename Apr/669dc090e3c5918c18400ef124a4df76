Committing the body of Mama Sam to mother earth in the presence of family members, friends and church members, the President, Supernatural Love Ministry Abuja, Archbishop Calvin Antonza, said Mama Sam was in a better place. “Mama is in a better place. Everyone must allow God process to finish in her life,” Antonza said. On his part, Bishop Edwin Jarumai from the Supernatural Love Ministry, Abuja, described Mama Sam as peaceful, urging parents to emulate her good virtues. The surviving eldest son of the deceased, Mr Joseph Nda-Isaiah, said even though it was painful to be apart with his mother, they are happy that Mama Sam was in a better place. “We are feeling bad but there is always time for separation. We are happy that where she has gone to is a better place,” Joseph said.
