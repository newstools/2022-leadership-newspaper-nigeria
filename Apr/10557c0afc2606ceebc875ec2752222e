The minister of information and culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who disclosed this at the inauguration of the Governing Board of the NBC yesterday in Abuja, said the pilot phase of the project was launched in Jos, Plateau State, on 30 April 2016 and, since then, it had launched the DSO in the Federal Capital Territory, as well as in Kwara, Kaduna, Enugu, Osun, Lagos and Kano states. On the role of the board, he said their role is to formulate policies, and not to engage in the day-to-day running of the organization. The minister said, “The Board is to evolve strategic ways of supporting the commission so it can most effectively deliver its mandate. “I, therefore, enjoin you all to maintain a cordial relationship with the chief executive officer of the Commission to engender a smooth working relationship.” Also, as the nation moves closer to the 2023 general elections, he said NBC will come under increasing pressure to step up its regulatory role to prevent a repeat of what transpired before, during, and after the 2019 general elections, when some broadcast stations threw caution to the wind and engaged in inciting, incendiary and unprofessional broadcasts. “It is important for the Commission to ensure that its licensees adhere strictly to the tenets of the Broadcasting Code,” he added.
