An estimated 1.3 billion tonnes of food is wasted globally each year, one third of all food
produced for human consumption, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. ‘‘In Sub-Saharan Africa, postharvest food losses are estimated to be worth USD 4 billion per year – or enough to feed at least 48 million people, according to the UN Environment Programme. The amount of food lost or wasted costs 2.6 trillion USD each year and is more than enough to feed the world’s 815 million hungry people four times over.
