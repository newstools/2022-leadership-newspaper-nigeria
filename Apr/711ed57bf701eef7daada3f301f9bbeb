A presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr. Ibrahim Bello Dauda, has said that he will develop a broad-range youth employment roadmap to tackle the high rate of unemployment and enable young Nigerians export their human capital and services when elected president come 2023. Dauda, who spoke to journalists in Abuja on Tuesday during a round-table, said the development plan will focus on broad-range entrepreneurial skills built on several lines rather than getting paid jobs in government. He said this was necessary as Nigeria cannot continue to neglect such lucrative aspect of the economy which has capacity to turn around the fortunes of the skilful young Nigerians to improve foreign earnings and accelerate sustainable development. To achieve this, the presidential hopeful added that he will empower the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) and bring the establishment up to speed with global ICT development and create a digital platform to co-opt artisan skills and incentives necessary to scale up entrepreneurs to global recognition. He said, “Were going to improve our capacity to export human capital and services, what we’re going to do firstly is to improve on the capacity of NDE and those offices and bringing them up to speed in terms of structure and infrastructure and then include ICT, which is what is redefining the entire sphere of development globally, so we are going to have a very comprehensive youth development plan that will center on entrepreneurship  development on several lines rather than getting the paid job in government. “We are going to create a digital platform included in the artisans skills acquisition, and then train these young people and give them the necessary incentives to be on their own so that they will begin to earn money in dollars, meaning Nigeria will begin to export services rather than concentrate on important goods.” On security roadmap, Dr Dauda said, “What we will do is going to do more on the preventing and to do that, there are steps that we’ll be taking, which include properly securing the borders because arms and ammunition are  brought into Nigeria through the porous borders. “The porous borders are not easy to police using man personnel, so we’re going to do a hybrid of both digital, utilising the various sources of intelligence and satellite capabilities and unmanned aerial vehicles, so it’s going to be a hybrid system, the objective is to be preventive rather than reactive and then cut off the supply of arms and disrupt the logistics structure, that way you cut up the oxygen and you allow them to die naturally.”
