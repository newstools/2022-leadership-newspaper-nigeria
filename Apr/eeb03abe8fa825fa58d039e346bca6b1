The father of the wife of Borno State governor, Dr Falmata Umara Zulum, Alhaji Kauna Bulama Kyari, is dead. Kyari, aged 70, died on Thursday night after a protracted illness. The death was disclosed by the press secretary to the First Lady, Hajiya Aisha Ngubdo, in a statement she issued to journalists on Friday in Maiduguri, Borno State capital. The statement reads: “Innalillahi wa inna illahi rajiun. The death has occurred of Alhaji Kauna Bulama kyari.
