World soccer ruling body, FIFA has set in motion an investigation the pitch invasion that occurred after the Nigeria-Ghana World Cup qualifier played at the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja. A statement  released by FIFA,said it is analysing official match reports, and will then decide if action will be taken against the Nigeria Football Federation. “The relevant information included in the match reports will be evaluated by the competent disciplinary bodies before deciding on the next steps to be taken,” the  FIFA statement added. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) could face sanctions from world governing body Fifa after crowd trouble marred the end of their 2022 World Cup play-off against Ghana. Home fans reacted angrily after the Super Eagles were eliminated from qualifying on the away goals rule following a 1-1 draw in Abuja on Tuesday. Players and staff were pelted with water bottles from the stands as they left the pitch at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, and Nigeria supporters then invaded the pitch. The crowd had overturned and damaged two dugouts before tear gas was used and police hit out at fans with batons.
