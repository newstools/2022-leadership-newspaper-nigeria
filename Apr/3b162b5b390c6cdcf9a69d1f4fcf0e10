Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, is set to speak formally on speculations that he is interested in running for the Presidency next year. According to a source in the Villa, Osinbajo could be speaking “in a matter of days.” Although different pro-Osinbajo campaign posters had been sighted in Abuja, a new campaign poster seen yesterday by LEADERSHIP indicates strongly that the vice president may be ready to throw his hat in the ring. If he does, he would be the 5th aspirant on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), to openly declare interest, potentially setting him against his former boss and Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The poster sighted by LEADERSHIP carried the inscription, “Get Ready, Get Set: It is happening soon. #PYO2023.” Speculations were rife last week that Osinbajo may have his intention to run, but the decision was put on hold after the Kaduna-bound train attack by bandits. The delay by APC’s new executive to announce the timetable primaries may have also stalled the announcement. Diverse groups have been campaigning for the vice president as “a natural successor” to President Muhammadu Buhari. Three months ago, former military president, General Ibrahim Babangida (rtd), endorsed Osinbajo to contest for the office of president come 2023 general elections when a pressure group, Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation (OGO), paid him a courtesy visit at his Hilltop Residence in Minna, Niger State. Other APC chieftains, that have openly declared intention to run include Governor Dave Umahi (Ebonyi); Governor Yahaya Bello (Kogi); and Senator Rochas Okorocha.
