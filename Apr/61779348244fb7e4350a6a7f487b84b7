The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has granted Airtel Mobile Commerce Nigeria Ltd, a subsidiary of Airtel Africa, a full super-agent licence.  This licence will allow the telecom operator to create an agency network servicing the customers of licensed Nigerian banks, payment service banks and licensed mobile money operators in Nigeria.  In a notification to Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX), Airtel disclosed that this final approval followed an earlier approval-in-principle given by the apex bank back in November 2021.
