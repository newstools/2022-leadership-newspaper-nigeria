Presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr Ibrahim Dauda, has said he decided to vy for President of Nigeria to provide credible leadership for the country. Dauda, who is one of the youngest aspirants in the race for APC presidential ticket made this know when he presented his policy document tilted: “Nigeria First” to LEADERSHIP in Abuja yesterday. He said his first priority is to redirect the country onto the path of credible leadership. The Borno State born accountant is confident that he has the capacity to right the wrongs of the country by realigning and reorganising the country to be responsive to the ideals of democracy and the constitution. He said Nigeria is desirous of a young leadership that has the vigour and aspiration to lead the country to genuine development across the nation. “We are looking at creating an enabling environment for development to prosper and you cannot do that until you stabilise certain factors, which is power, rail, road, that is transportation, agriculture and education itself. “We are also going to create entrepreneurs, because when you create jobs, it means you are going to create an army of people into public service and then the bulk of the money you make from the IGR will be used in paying salaries, you will be left with almost nothing for the capital, so we are going to shift from job creation to entrepreneurial development where majority of our youths will be trained and their energies will be redirected towards the private sector and we are going to remove most of the red tapes and bottlenecks in accessing funding,” Dauda said. He listed some his top priorities to include fighting insecurity, improving the economy, education, restructuring, and women and youth inclusiveness. He said his entry into the APC race for the presidential ticket presents Nigerians a chance to relish the finest traits of democracy in 2023.
