The Kaduna State Universal Basic Education Board (KAD-SUBEB) has handed over two newly constructed classroom blocks to Zaria local government, as part of the administration’s efforts to provide conducive learning environment for pupils. A statement issued by KAD-SUBEB said that a block of six classrooms was constructed at the Waziri Lawal Primary School and 12 classrooms were built at Anguwan Bishir Primary School. The statement added that office blocks and toilets have also been constructed in the new classroom blocks which have been handed over. It will be recalled that the Malam Nasir El-Rufai administration has constructed about 927 new classrooms from 2015 till date and it is building new schools across the state. Specifically, Kaduna State Government has built seven new schools for gifted and talented pupils, with one in Danbushiya , another in Pambegua, and the rest in Hunkuyi, Buruku, Jere, Manchok and Rigachikun towns; The APC-led administration has also made education free and compulsory in Kaduna state, from primary to senior secondary school levels, in addition to providing free textbooks and uniforms to primary school pupils and secondary school students. Last year, the administration procured textbooks, handbooks and e-books worth over N800 million for the basic and post basic education, just as it spent N800 million on free uniforms in 2020.
