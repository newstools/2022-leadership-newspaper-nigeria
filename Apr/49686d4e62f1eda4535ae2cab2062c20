The Presidency has faulted River State governor, Nyesom Wike’s criticism of the state pardon granted to former governors Jolly Nyame and Joshua Dariye. Presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a series of tweet on his official Tweeter handle said Wike was invited to the Council of State meeting were the decision was taken but did not attend. Shehu said Wike’s deputy, Dr. Ipalibo Banigo, who attended the meeting didn’t make her position known on the matter during the meeting. Shehu wrote, “I do not see the moral justification for Governor Wike’s criticism of the decision of the government to pardon Governors Dariye and Nyame at a meeting to which he was duly invited but did not attend. “The Rivers State Deputy Governor, Dr. Ipalibo Banigo who joined the Council of State meeting virtually switched off her camera so it was difficult to determine whether she sat behind the dark screen or just walked away after first joining. “If the Governor felt so strongly about the pardons, the right was for him or his representative to sit through the meeting and assert views. This did not do. A press release after the meeting is bolekaja politics.”
