Troops of 34 Artillery Brigade Nigerian Army (NA) on Easter Sunday neutralized a member of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra(IPOB) and its armed affiliate Eastern Security Network(ESN) at Ihioma Community in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State. The director of Army Public Relations Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu said the troops on 17 April 2022 while on routine patrol encountered members of the group at Banana Junction to enforce the illegal sit-at-home order on law-abiding citizens going about their legitimate businesses. “The IPOB/ESN criminals on sighting the troops, withdrew in a blue Toyota Highlander towards Ihioma Community for reinforcement”. He said the group fired sporadically at the Nigerian Army personnel, adding that in the fire fight that ensued, one of the criminals was killed while others fled in disarray.He said the troops were combing the general area in a follow up operation to track down the fleeing dissidents. “Having suffered casualty and effectively denied freedom of action by the troops, the irredentist groups have resorted to cheap propaganda to whip up public sentiments by circulating a doctored video on the social media alleging troops’ complicity in their mindless atrocities.” He therefore called on the general public to disregard the propaganda in its entirety.
