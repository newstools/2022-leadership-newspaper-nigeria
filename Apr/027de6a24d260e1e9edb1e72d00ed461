The suspects, Bello Sani, Venab Puncat and Yusuf Nahoda, all of Ibi Local Government Area of Taraba, during interrogation confessed to have purchased one AK47 rifle, and one SMG rifle at the cost of N900,000.  The FPRO said concerted effort has been activated to arrest their collaborators and recover the exhibits.  The inspector-general of Police, IGP Usman Baba, while commending the successes recorded by the FIB-IRT, reassured members of the public of his administration’s commitment to the fight against common enemies of the nation who are hell-bent on causing pains, tears and agony to Nigerians.
