I have also had the privilege to be elected a second time to the Senate of the Federal Republic in 2019 where I currently serve the good people of Ogun Central Senatorial District,” Amosun wrote. He noted that his varied experience in private and public life has imbued him with requisite insights, experiences and network of relationships adequate to provide a leadership that will galvanise Nigeria “to achieve her manifest destiny as leader in Africa and of the black race.” “I will be honoured with your esteemed presence and that of my Distinguished Colleagues at the Declaration event. “I seek the prayers of all of you for a successful declaration ceremony, victory at the party primaries and the 2023 presidential election,” the lawmaker stated.
