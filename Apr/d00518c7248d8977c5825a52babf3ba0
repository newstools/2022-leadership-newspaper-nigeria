Members of the Stanford Seed Transformation Network Nigeria, a network of business leaders from different sectors in Nigeria have commended the CEO/managing director, Fibroid Care Centre, Dr. Abayomi Ajayi, for bringing High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) to Nigeria. Members of the Stanford Seed Transformation Network Nigeria, who went on a tour of the Fibroid Care Centre, in Lagos, during the weekend, said the centre will help to tackle medical tourism in Nigeria. The president, the Stanford Seed Transformation Network Nigeria who is also the CEO IMC Plantations, Brian Hammond, said the health sector is lagging behind in so many ways. However, health facilities like the Fibroid Care Centre are helping to change the narrative, Hammond said, adding that the Fibroid Care Centre has helped to tackle medical tourism in the country and transformed the health sector, with its state-of-the-art technology. “Our members visited the Fibroid centre and we are impressed. The fibroid center is the first centre in Nigeria, that has the HIFU machine in the whole of West Africa. This indeed will improve the treatment of fibroids in Nigeria,” he added. In the same vein, the CEO, Fibroids Care Centre, Dr. Abayomi Ajayi, said HIFU is a non-invasive way to treat uterine fibroids, adding that, it uses real-time ultrasound and high-intensity ultrasound waves to generate localized heat to specifically target individual fibroids to destroy the cells. Using this treatment method, in conjunction with image guidance, Ajayi said, the physician will be able to heat and destroy the fibroid tissue without damaging nearby tissue or the tissues that the beam passes through on its way to the target.
