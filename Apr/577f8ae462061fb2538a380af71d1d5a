With preparations for the 2023 general election gathering momentum, two aspirants have declared their intentions to contest for the governorship position of Abia State under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Chief Ncheta Omerekpe, addressing the party members during his declaration at the party’s secretariat in Umuahia, the state capital, said the state had never needed a committed leadership as it does now since 1999. Omerekpe said considering his background and vast wealth of experience, he has the capacity to move the state forward, saying the anointing of an aspirant by the Ngwa nation members of the party was unacceptable to him. He expressed dissatisfaction with the state of infrastructure, amenities, and social services in the state which he blamed on incompetence and lack of vision and commitment by successive administrations. A former member of the state House of Assembly, Dr Samson Orji, in his declaration stressed that the primaries should be free, fair and credible to give room for the emergence of the most qualified candidate. “The party will do well if there is a plain playing field for the aspirants. I am sure I will win under a free, fair and credible primaries,” the former representative of Arochukwu state constituency added. He regretted that despite its huge potentials, the state is still lagging far behind in internally generated revenue which he argued would have been enough to make the state the economic gateway of the South East.
