The DG, who stated this yesterday at a press briefing in Abuja, said the agency was working on uploading some tools on laptops for its staff members and they are going to be using a device that cost about $57,000 per one, of which they have already gotten 40 of them, amounting to $2,280,000. In her description of the device, she said it is like a cell phone. “When we place it on them, it will show the product and the quantity, we are doing that because that is what we want to see and that is why we are putting all these things in place. “We are also doing track and trace, a highly technical process to monitor change, meaning from the manufacturer to the consumer, it is a five-year plan. We are doing that to ensure we mitigate substandard modified medicine but it is not something we can do overnight, we started with COVID-19 vaccine, we know where every vaccine in the country is because of the track and trace technique,” she said. Adeyeye said the innovation was part of the agency’s efforts at mitigating fake drugs in the country, noting that the faking system is so advanced that it makes it difficult to distinguish between fake and genuine medicine. “Sometimes, those who fake medicine, you may not be able to distinguish it. There was a report that about 70 per cent of our drugs are fake, that is not true because we are doing risk-based assessment of products that we know can be easily faked. It is part of our maturity level consideration by the World Health Organisation (WHO), “We have to show them that we have a mechanism in place to go after products that can be easily faked, and then it is a survey, we can have an idea of how much there is that can be fake; it is around 13 to 15 per cent.  But we are going to be mitigating it,” she said. On the Agency’s new certification by WHO, Adeyeye said NAFDAC does not manufacture vaccines but gives guidelines.
