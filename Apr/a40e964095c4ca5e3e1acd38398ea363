He said, “Contrary to this falsehood, it is pertinent to note that as a member of the Armed Forces, I have sworn my allegiance to defend the country and protect the lives and properties of all citizens devoid of any ethnic, religious or pecuniary sentiments.” Gen.

He expressed hope that more weapons would be recovered from the public as they continue to collaborate for the recovery of small arms and light weapons from the hands of non-state actors.
