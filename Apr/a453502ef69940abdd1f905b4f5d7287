Eyo, who spoke on behalf of state chairman of the association, Comrade Emmanuel Ntamu, confirmed that state government has  paid all pensions except for few pensioners with one or two technical issues. He said that those yet to be paid would soon be cleared immediately when those little errors found by the consultant are rectified.
