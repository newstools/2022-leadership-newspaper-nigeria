The Super Eagles will then fly to either São Tomé or Port Louis for their matchday two encounter. The window for these two matches is 30th May – 14th June. In September, with the window for Matchdays 3 & 4 being 19th – 27th September, the Eagles will tango home and away with the Wild Dogs of Guinea-Bissau. The Matchdays 5 & 6 are within the period 20th – 28th March 2023, and will see the Eagles go away to Freetwon before returning home to square up to either São Tomé and Príncipe or Mauritius. The Confederation of African Football will have to determine the team that will compete in the group between Sao Tome and Mauritius. The top two teams in the group will qualify for the 34th Africa Cup of Nations finals taking place in Cote d’Ivoire next summer.
