Justice Emeka Nwite of a Federal High Court, Abuja, has dismissed a bail application filed by ASP Bawa James, a co-defendant in the drug trafficking case filed against suspended DCP Abba Kyari and others. The court in its ruling held that the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) had succeeded in proving its argument beyond reasonable doubt, why the court should not admit James to a bail. The NDLEA had on March 7, arraigned Kyari (1st defendant) and six others on allegations bordering on dealing in illicit drugs. He was arraigned alongside four suspended police officers including ACP Sunday Ubia, ASP James, Insp. Simon Agirigba and Insp. John Nuhu as 2nd to 5th defendants respectively. Also arraigned with them are Chibunna Umeibe and Emeka Ezenwanne, the two alleged drug traffickers, who were arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu. Although the five police officers pleaded not guilty to all the charges against them, Umeibe and Ezenwanne, who are 6th and 7th defendants respectively, pleaded guilty to five, six and seven counts preferred against them. Ruling on the bail application on Thursday, the judge aligned with the argument of counsel to NDLEA, Joseph Sunday, that James (3rd defendant) was a flight risk and that he might jump bail. Nwite said that the 3rd defendant had failed to bring up strong evidence to challenge the anti-narcotic agency’s submission that the character of evidence against him was very serious. He said though the defence argued that the court had the discretionary power to rule in favour of the applicant since the offence was a bailable one, he was, however, mindful to consider the submission of the prosecution.
