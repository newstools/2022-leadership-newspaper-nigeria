CHI Limited, in the spirit of the season, has encouraged the Muslim faithful to complement their Sahur and Iftar meals with nutritional requirements needed to stay fit throughout the holy month, and achieve a spiritually robust as well as successful fast. According to the company, this came as millions of Muslim faithfuls have begun devoting themselves to fasting, prayer, and communal bonding as required during the holy month of Ramadan. In a statement by the company, Chi Limited, through its latest communication campaign tagged “Let the Blessings flow from Sahur to Iftar” and “We’re with You Every Step of the Way,” deployed across TV, Radio, Digital and Out of Home Channels, CHI Limited highlights the spiritual blessings associated with fasting during the holy month of Ramadan. ‘‘Nutritionists say it is important for people fasting to be aware of the importance of healthy nourishment. During fasting hours when no food or drink is consumed, the body may become mildly dehydrated. When first breaking the fast, drinks with natural electrolytes and essential vitamins like juices or yoghurt can provide energy, and replace fluids that are good to keep the stomach balanced, which is exactly what is required after a whole day of not eating. Chivita fruit juices and Hollandia dairy brands are renowned for the healthy nourishment they provide,’’ the statement read in part.Marketing director, CHI Limited, Mrs. Toyin Nnodi, said that the objective of the Ramadan campaign is to communicate our support for Muslim faithful during the Ramadan fast by ensuring they nourish their bodies as they nourish their souls.“Our range of Chivita juices and Hollandia dairy brands provide consumers the right nourishment to complement their Sahur and Iftar meals to enable them stay hydrated, nourished and healthy through the course of the Ramadan fast,” she stated.
