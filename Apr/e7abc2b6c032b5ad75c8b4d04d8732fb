The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has appealed to host communities to assist in the fight against vandalism of the nation’s  collective power assets, by reporting suspicious activities around its operations to its offices or to security operatives. The managing director/chief executive officer, TCN, Engr. Dr. Sule Ahmed Abdulaziz made the appeal yesterday, when he led other management staff to undertake an on-the-spot assessment of the vandalised tower 104, along Odukpani/Ikot Ekpene 330kV transmission line in Oku Iboku Community, Itu local government area of Akwa Ibom state. Recall that the minister of Power, Aliyu Abubakar, had disclosed that vandals were responsible for a disruption of the transmission tower between Akwa Ibom and Cross River states last Friday. The development led to the collapse of the country’s electricity grid twice within three hours, at about 6:30 pm on Friday and crashed again at about 8:30 pm. The grid, has collapsed about half a dozen times this year alone. The vandalised tower caused a sudden loss of 400MW from the grid  causing its collapse last Friday. The grid has since been restored, the TCN said.
