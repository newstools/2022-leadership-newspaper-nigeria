Ahead of plans to resume train service by the Nigerian Railway Corporation, NRC, in two weeks’ time after the repair of the 1,500 kilometer concrete slabs/tracks, along the Abuja-Kaduna railway corridor recently attacked by terrorists, the Nigerian Union of Railway Workers NUR, has called on the management of the corporation to suspend night train service pending the deployment of security gadgets to monitor activities along the corridor. This  is coming as President Muhammad Buhari has ordered the corporation and relevant government agencies to expedite action on the repair of the 1,500 kilometer concrete slabs/tracks damaged  by the terrorists and processing of documentations for the procurement of satellite/drones respectively. According to a statement signed by secretary general of NUR, Comrade Segun Esan the union regretted that “there is no proof that all our observations expressed to the Nigerian Railway Corporation’s management on improving the security and safety of the train service were taken especially our advice that night train service be stopped till security situation of the service is improved with on-train CCTV, explosives detectors and other technology-based approaches”. The union therefore appealed to all Nigerian Railway workers in particular and to all Nigerian families whose members might have been affected in one way or the other by this terrorist attack. He stated further that  the union is still gathering information and processing same analytically with a view to arriving at rational convergence leading to making a definite official pronouncement adding that the President general and members of the Central Working Committee will visit AKTS very shortly in order to have a first-hand assessment of the incident. Esan also expressed concern about some railway workers and other innocent commuting passengers who might have been tragically traumatized or sustained various degrees of wounds in the incident.
