Adhoc delegates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Gombe State were taken aback on Monday, when the name of the incumbent Senator representing Gombe Central on the the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Danjuma Goje, appeared on the PDP ballot papers for the conduct of the party’s senatorial primary election for the zone. Recall that there were insinuations in recent times that Senator Goje would defect from APC and recontest for the Gombe Central seat on the platform of the PDP due to the political feud between him and the state governor, Inuwa Yahaya. The national headquarters of the APC through a peace and reconciliation committee by Abdullahi Adamu brokered truce between the two party bigwigs, a development that made Goje to change his mind. But on Monday during the PDP primaries, his name appeared as one of the aspirants contesting for the Gombe Central senatorial seat under the umbrella of the PDP. Meanwhile, Goje scored zero out of the 66 votes cast whith Abubakar Aliyu polling 59 votes and thereby emerged winner.
