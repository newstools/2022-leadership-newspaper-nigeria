    The first lady who was accompanied by the minister and Mrs Osinbajo to Adamu’s office was met behind closed doors with the national chairman. LEADERSHIP gathered that the meeting may not be unconnected with certain political interest, especially the push by the first lady for women to get more elective positions in the 2023 general election. But speaking with journalists after the meeting, Aisha Buhari said they were on a solidarity visit to congratulate the Adamu-APC leadership for being honoured with the privilege to lead the party. She said, “We are here to congratulate the national chairman for the opportunity God has given him to lead this great party and to thank him for the good work he has started. Finally, we are encouraging him not to forget women in all elective positions”. On her party, Tallen, who noted that women’s role is critical in national development and all elective positions, however, refused to comment on why she suddenly made a u-turn on her senatorial ambition.
