The National Secretary of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Samuel  Anyanwu, has denied the purported disqualification of opposition coalition’s spokesperson, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, from running for elective office under the platform of the PDP. This is coming barely 24 hours after Anyawu’s Special Adviser on Media, Ikenna Onuoha, referred Ugochinyere as a ‘disqualified’ aspirant. Addressing the PDP National Caucus on Thursday on the alleged disqualification of Ugochinyere, the PDP National Secretary denied the action and informed the party’s caucus that Ugochinyere was still in the race and was never disqualified. He maintained that the documents in circulation were not from the party but forged documents put in circulation by mischief-makers, who want to drag his name and the party into the mud. It will be recalled that Ugochinyere was cleared by the PDP National Assembly Screening Panel and issued a certificate of clearance after which the Appeal Panel upheld his clearance and few days after, the social and mainstream media platforms were awash with the report on his purported disqualification, which led to the present controversies and allegations of forgery and fabrication, which the PDP National Secretary has cleared before the National Caucus. The controversies that trailed the purported disqualification of Ugochinyere had ignited emotions in the state, and had cast the party in bad light.
