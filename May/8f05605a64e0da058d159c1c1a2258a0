Maintaining its impressive run this week, stock market analysts expect bargain hunting to persist in equities, as more investors are positioned to hedge against rising inflation. As the nation’s economy sustained its positive GDP growth in Q3 and Q4 2021 as shown in the report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), all eyes are on the 2022 Q1 national output expected for release May 24, 2022, while the April consumer price index is slated for release on May 16, 2022, to show the true state of the economy. These expected macroeconomic indices and the decline in fixed income market yields in the face of higher stock market earnings yields are likely to attract more funds into equities. Also, all eyes are on the next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). Analysts Optimism The chief operating officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Mr Ambrose Omordion said, investors will continue to search for commodity-backed stocks with good fundamentals and positive returns above the inflation rate, besides the fact that players are keenly observing what is happening on the nation’s economic front, as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Treasury Bills rate for the 364-day decline slightly at the end of the weekly auction. “On this note, we expect the fixed income market players to hedge against the spiraling inflation in stocks with high earnings yields. Stakeholders are, however, anxiously awaiting plans by the CBN to intervene in the petrol products sector, which as announced is targeted at making premium motor spirit and diesel available, thereby easing the pain of manufacturers, SMEs, and households across the country, in the face of the epileptic power supply.  Just as the National Assembly ordered the NNPC to provide aviation fuel for local airlines. “The uptick in domestic inflation is a potent threat to the fixed income market and investment yields, which should be an indication that more funds may likely flow into the equity space as institutional investors balance their portfolios,” he said. In the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited expect equities to trade higher as positive Q1, 2022 financial results keep rolling out and also the continuous crash in the US equities market will as well spur bullish sentiment on the local bourse. Cordros Securities Limited said: “in the near term, we think the bears are likely to book profit across most counters given the five-week bullish run in the market. Thus, we see more of a ‘choppy theme’ as cautious trading takes center stage ahead of the MPC meeting scheduled later in the month. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Last Week’s Trading Activities Despite the rout across the global equities market, the rally in the Nigerian equities market remained unscathed as intense bargain hunting activities in cyclical stocks pushed the All-Share Index higher, last week.
