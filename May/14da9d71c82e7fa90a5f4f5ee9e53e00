LEADERSHIP observed that no fewer than 29 pro-Abe supporters were screened and cleared to participate in Thursday’s House of Assembly primary election. Coordinator of Bola Ahmed Tinubu Support (BATS) Vanguard in Rivers State, Chief Tony Okocha, in a statement issued on behalf of the governorship aspirant and his supporters, said the process in the state was already skewed, biased and prejudiced. The statement reads in part: “I have been receiving myriad of calls from our colleagues concerning the nation-wide Assembly and governorship candidates Primaries of our darling party, APC.
Please, kindly take this as Official Statement that we are not participating in an already skewed, biased and prejudiced process in Rivers. “All our teeming supporters are advised not to dissipate scarce energies in a Process that will not pass muster. Comfortably lounge in houses and homes and be exceedingly happy, with no interest in the usual charade of APC Rivers. “However, we enjoin all to remain vigilant as we continue to bring you up to speed with unfolding events. More than resolutely keep faith with the struggle. He who laughs last, laughs best.”
