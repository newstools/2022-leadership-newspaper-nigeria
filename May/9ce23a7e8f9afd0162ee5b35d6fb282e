Stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry have lamented massive brain drain from Africa, saying the continent risks a medicine crisis if prompt actions are not taken to avert the increasing problems of brain-drain in the pharmaceutical industry. This is just as no less than 126 newly trained pharmacists were yesterday inducted into the West African Postgraduate College of Pharmacists (WAPCP). The stakeholders lamented that such problems as increasing migration of professionals to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, among others, and heavy reliance on importation and donation of medicines, as well as supply distribution gaps, were critical issues putting the region at a risk of a medical crisis. Stakeholders who expressed fear at the opening ceremony of the 34th West African Postgraduate College of Pharmacists (WAPCP) Annual General Meeting and Scientific Symposium, held in Lagos agreed the situation demands urgent attention and collaborative efforts among the professionals and the government. In his keynote address, the Managing Director, SKG Pharma Ltd,  Dr. Okey Akpa, explained that the 381 million population in West Africa were at risk of a medicine crisis, saying the effects of the same are those that transcend national violence. Lamenting that only about 30 percent of medicines consumed in West Africa were produced in the region, he said the region is exposed to the risk of a medicine crisis with increasing migration of pharmaceutical professionals out of the region. In her remarks, the chairman of the occasion, who is the chairman of Access Bank, Dr. Ajoritsedere Awosika, said the theme of the Symposium “Medicine Security in the West African Region: Matters Arising,” was apt.
