The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Cross River State has concluded plans to cut down the number of individuals aspiring to contest governorship election to succeed Governor Ben Ayade when his tenure elapses in 2023 on the platform of party from 16 to four. APC state chairman, Alphonsus Eba disclosed this yesterday while answering questions from journalists during a media briefing at the party secretariat in Calabar. Eba spoke shortly after the party leadership inaugurated a committee to drive the process. The committee that will help the party prune down number of aspirants from 16 to four, will be headed by former senate leader, Victor Ndoma-Egba, alongside Senator Florence Ita Giwa. He stated that by that arrangement, the committee will be charged with the responsibility of selecting  two aspirants from the south with  another two from the central so that they can purchase  party’s expression of interest and nomination forms for the 2023 general election. The state party chairman stressed that the decision to prune the number of individuals aspiring for the seat of governor to four is to prevent party men from wasting money given the economic reality, adding that the four aspirants will subsequently be presented to the state caucus who will take the final decision. “We are not going to force anybody to agree with us. We will allow those who refused to listen to us to go ahead with their plan. The party has not zoned the governorship seat to any senatorial district,” Eba stressed.
