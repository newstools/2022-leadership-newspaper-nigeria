He made this known when he visited the Niger State delegates at Government House Minna, seeking their vote to become the party’s flag bearer. Senator Lawan said voting him is voting for peace, unity, economic and educational development, security and invariably the stability of the nation. “For the last three years I have been the Senate President and I have been able to work very well with my colleagues, have made the senate very peaceful and cooperative, it’s that kind of stability, peace and unity that I want to bring to the villa in 2023,” he stated. He however added that “We have to educate our youth, give them the best education at primary and secondary schools as future leaders. I will reform the educational system.” The presidential aspirant posited that he is competent, capable and experienced to take Nigeria out of its present predicaments like poverty and insecurity bedeviling the nation. To do this he explained that the security architecture of the country must be considered to the extent that citizens who give security information are protected and traditional institutions play a role in the security of the country. Responding, the governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, told the delegates that the aspirant has laid down his plans for the state and Nigeria for consideration and urged delegates to decipher his points and make a decision.
