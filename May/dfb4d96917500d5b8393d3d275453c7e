According to the chairman of the swimming section of the club, Kunle Adeniji, all is set for the competition as he also praised the sponsors, Zenith Bank for their support. It would be recalled that Grange School retained Zenith Bank/ Ikoyi Club Inter School Swimming meet recently with Kalu siblings, Chukwudi and Chioma at the forefront of the Ikeja-based school’s triumph accounting for nine of their 21 medals  – 13 gold, 7 silver and 1 bronze. Adeniji stressed the importance of catching them young while revealing that some of the swimmers that competed in the secondary school meet have competed at the primary school level before. “It is more difficult to handle the kids from primary school, but at the same time their competwwition is always interesting,” he said. “They are our children and with proper grooming, I am sure they are going to become the best in no distant future. “We thank Zenith Bank for always coming to support us all these years and looking forward to the future with them.” Group Managing Director of Zenith Bank, Ebenezer Onyeagwu, said the outfit would continue to bring out hidden talents for the country. He added: “Zenith Bank is committed to sports development and that is why we focus on youth programmes so that we can raise future champions for Nigeria.”
