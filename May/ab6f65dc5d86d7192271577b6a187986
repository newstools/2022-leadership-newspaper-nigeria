Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni has called on the Academic Staff Union of University (ASUU) of the state-owned university, Yobe State University, to reconsider their position in the ongoing strike by the union’s national body. Buni, who met with the management of the school and the union, said the state government and the university had no outstanding issues between them and hence no justification for the long closure of the institution. The lecturers have been on strike for over two months to demand for better funding, improved welfare and facilities in the nation’s universities. Represented at the meeting by the Secretary to the State Government, Baba Malam Wali, the governor also called on the lecturers to consider the plight of the students who have had their studies paused by the strike. According to him, “We called for this meeting to appeal to you, the management of the university, and unions to review your earlier decision of joining the ongoing nationwide strike embarked upon by the national body as a mark of solidarity. “Considering the outcry by parents and students of YSU and bearing in mind that there are virtually no outstanding issues between the State Government, the management of YSU and the Unions, we feel that your action in not justified,” Buni said.
