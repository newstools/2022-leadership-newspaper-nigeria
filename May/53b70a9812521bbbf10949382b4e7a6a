Speaking with reporters during a virtual conference last yesterday, managing director of NSIA, Uche Orji said despite the challenging year, the Fund was able to finish the strong with a solid financial outcome for its contributors.  In details, stated that Presidential Fertiliser Initiative (PFI) made profit in 2021 eliminating the need for government subsidy, while making significant progress on developing the Ammonia and Di-Ammonium Phosphate production plants in Ikot-Abasi in partnership with OCP in its gas industrialization programme.  Mr Orji spoke to 2022 investment year, saying the rising global inflation inflation will be more delicate for Central Banks to manage borrowing from the crisis in Ukraine and Russia, adding that global commodity prices will continue to surge. “I think 2022 is going to be the toughest year of investment for over the last 15 years due to globally rising inflation,” which he said is always dangerous to investment. It will be a taught year for investing across the globe. He said if the federal reserves are not able to manage it well, it could lead to stagflation that would drag in for a long time. Orji said the NSIA is transforming itself from being funds manager to asset manager. He said they will be doing that in power sector, industrial assets that have been left to rot away and properties. The NSIA boss said what used to be an asset of the NSIA has been transferred to the Ministry of Finance incorporated.
