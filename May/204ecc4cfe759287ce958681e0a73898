President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with families of those who died, sustained injuries, and were affected in the building collapse at Ebute Metta area of Lagos State, with search and rescue still ongoing at the site. The President, who was pained by this tragic incident, in a statement by his media aide, Femi Adesina, on Monday, saluted the courage and determination of the first responders, national and sub-national emergency agencies in Lagos State, and compassionate Nigerians, whose immediate action in the aftermath of the collapse of the three-storey building led to the rescue of several persons, including many children. Regrettably, the President noted that the frequency of building collapses in the country has become increasingly embarrassing, urging the relevant state authorities to work closely with professional bodies to put a halt to the unfortunate but preventable incidents. President Buhari wished those injured a speedy recovery and prayed for divine assistance in the ongoing search and rescue operations.
