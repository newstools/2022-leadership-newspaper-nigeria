The party issued the certificate to Ugochinyere after examination of the controversial circumstances of reports of his earlier disqualification despite the existence of panel reports by both the Screening Committee and Screening Appeal Committee that he was duly cleared to contest the election. The NWC had resolved that going by records in the party secretariat that Ugochinyere was cleared and that reports of his purported disqualification were mere fabrications and rumours from adversaries and not from any national officer of the party or indeed the party. While reacting to the presentation of the Certificate of Qualification, Ugochinyere hailed the PDP leadership led by Senator Iyorchia Ayu, for the presenting him with the certificate which clears the pathway for him to contest the primaries, describing the act as evidence of Ayu’s commitment to a transparent, free and fair process. Ugochinyere further thanked the party at both the State and local government levels and also the Nigerian public for their support and confidence which they reposed in him, pledging that he would ensure he does not disappoint the people. He also expressed confidence that he would emerge victorious at the party primaries and also vowed to lead the PDP to a landslide victory in the federal constituency at the general election.
