To this end, the presidency has cancelled all projects awarded by the interventionist agency for which the contractors have not mobilised to site from the year 2000 to December 31, 2019. A statement made available to LEADERSHIP in Port Harcourt yesterday by the NDDC’s director of corporate affairs, Dr Ibitoye Abosede, said the cancellation was subject to any future re-award in accordance with the Public Procurement Act. The statement reads in part: “This is to bring to the notice of all contractors engaged by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), as well as stakeholders and the general public, that the presidency has directed that all projects awarded by the commission before December 31, 2019, for which the beneficiary contractors are yet to mobilize to site, are by this directive cancelled. “According to the directive, this cancellation is subject to any future re-award in accordance with the Public Procurement Act and in line with the terms of the contracts for the award of the said projects. “Consequently, all affected contractors are advised to note that all monies earlier received by way of mobilisation for any of the projects are to be promptly refunded to the Commission’s Account with the Central Bank of Nigeria.”
