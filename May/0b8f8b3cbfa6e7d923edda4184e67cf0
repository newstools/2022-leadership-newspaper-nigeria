President Muhammadu Buhari, on Friday, held a farewell meeting with nine outgoing Ministers seeking elective offices in 2023 general election. This is even as the president said the vacant ministerial posts will be filled without delay. The session was sequel to the President’s recent directive to all ministers and political appointees with political ambitions to resign from their appointments on or before Monday, May 16, 2022. The outgoing Ministers include Minister of State for Mines and Steel Uche Ogar; Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva; Minister of Labour and Employment Chris Ngige; Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of Women Affairs, Paullen Tallen. Others are the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Goodwill Akpabio; Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, SAN; Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu, and Minister of State for Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Tayo Alasoadura. The immediate-past Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, who was the first to resign his position was, however, absent without any reason given. Speaking to State House correspondents after the valedictory session, Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, recalled that earlier on Wednesday the president directed that all ministers and political appointees seeking elective offices in 2023 should resign their current positions. He said a valedictory session was held for 10 members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) on Friday morning, who desire to aspire for higher offices, saying that, however, only nine of them were present. The minister said the president thanked the outgoing members of the cabinet for their services and in addition to wishing them success in their future endeavours.
