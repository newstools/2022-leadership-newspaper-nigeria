Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has expressed optimism about his chances of being reelected by the Lagos electorate in the 2023 general election in the state, saying he is very confident of victory at the polls. Governor Sanwo-Olu stated this when he submitted the Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms for his re-election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to party officials at the International Conference Centre, Abuja. The governor who was accompanied by a large crowd, which included members of the Lagos APC apex leadership body, Governance Advisory Council (GAC), Lagos State Executive Council and party executives, traditional rulers, APC chieftains, political associates, and supporters, among others said with support from the masses, he is confident of victory during the March 11, 2023, gubernatorial elections. He added that his administration is committed to the delivery of real dividends of democracy in all aspects of life to all Lagos residents. “We have put in place a robust economic agenda, which we call the THEMES developmental agenda and it has propelled all the various interventions that we’ve had in Lagos. “We know where we are as a nation, but Lagos continues to remain safe and secure. We have the highest foreign direct investments and it’s because the environment is safe and secure. It is because we have provided the platform for the Organised Private Sector to thrive. Mind you, Lagos during the pandemic period was the epicenter for COVID-19. “For about one and a half years, we slowed down but our slowing down didn’t slow down economic development. It gave us the opportunity to redouble our efforts and ensure that people can feel us meaningfully in all areas. We did not give excuses about COVID. In fact, COVID propelled us to have better health facilities as we speak today. We have improved our health infrastructure and the number of health practitioners that we have in all of our health institutions. “We are committed to the delivery of real dividends of democracy in all aspects of life and those are the things that propelled us. We kept asking Lagosians, what do we do? And they said they are appreciative of the first four years but they have given us assurance and the confidence for us to push forward and see the second term.” Harping on the 2023 presidential election expressed his support for rotation of the presidency to the South in line with the position of the Southern Governors Forum during its meeting in Lagos that the South should produce President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor on May 29, 2023. “I think that it is what is fair, justiciable and just. It is really about Nigeria but there are aspirations everywhere and there are so many eminent qualified people but in the spirit of equity and fairness that we have in our country, I think it is just morally fair that it goes to the South. And the South-West is showing serious interest in that space. So, we believe that our positions from those meetings are very valid,” he said.
