The actress disclosed that she needed a complete and god-fearing man, who is up to the task of marriage immediately. She made the announcement during an interview with BBC Igbo. She said: “Please, I use this opportunity to tell the world that I want to marry urgently. A great man should show himself and put a ring on this finger of mine. “My specification is a man who is God-fearing and handsome. “He must be up to the task, having everything that makes a man male, you must be complete, that’s all I can say.” Recall that the actress’s marriage to Charles Ekwu crashed in 2009.
