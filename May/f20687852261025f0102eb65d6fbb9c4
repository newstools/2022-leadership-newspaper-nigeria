Heart Heartists, a creative hub located in Utako, Abuja opened its doors for the first time to the public last Friday.  Contemporary dancer and founder of the multi-purpose space, Bukunmi Olukitibi described it as a safe space for artistes and creatives to breathe, create and protect the genuineness of their creation.  Experience have shown that caught in the web of the rat race and societal standards, particularly in a social media branding era, focus is easily diverted from living the process and experience of creating. To focus on creating, rather than the chase for fame, artistes need a space to keep them grounded, and in tune to why they create.  “I feel the whole world needs a safe space. But we cannot control what everyone does. The only thing we can do is build small hubs and communities like this where we can keep a level head, and our sanity, and protect the genuineness of our creation. The artistes when they want to create can come in here and feel like they can breathe. I am happy that most artistes that visited the hub before today felt that way, because that is my intention,” said Bukunmi. As a space, the hub, she said is ever evolving, not just in terms of physical space, but of the creators (artistes) and people visiting the space. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-377727" src="//i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220507-WA0014.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Heart Heartists" width="600" height="400" srcset="//i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220507-WA0014.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220507-WA0014.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220507-WA0014.jpg?resize=750%2C500&amp;ssl=1 750w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220507-WA0014.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1"> “For me, this is also a creation. My team and I are creating this space, and it is important that the creation takes as long as it will to become what it needs to become. And by space, I don’t mean the physical space alone, but we the creators, the visitors coming in, and the physical space itself continue to evolve.”  At the core of the hub’s activities is its community engagement programmes, of which its successfully executed five of it, including Anybody Can Dance, Dancers Emerge, Movement As Aid and Tool, and recently Stepping Stone kickstarted in January 2021.  Under Stepping Stone, Heart Heartists selected young dancers in the community of Saburi, Dei-Dei, training them in various dance styles – ballet, contemporary dance – and yoga. It organized a dance show for the young dancers in Transcorp last year, and takes them out occasionally to experience other art events outside their community.  The result is financial empowerment for some of the youths, such as Sarah Oluwasogo, a yoga trainee, currently teaching classes herself at the hub; and a few others that now create their own choreographies; while the rest can afford their transportation to and from Saburi to train at the hub.  “I create yoga classes that gives the client what they need, and not what’s in my head. Bukunmi would always say, “Don’t teach based off the routine in your head, rather teach based on the clients you see. Because if you come to a class with a routine and see a beginner, or a person with disability, you have to look for ways to teach that beginner or a person with disability. That’s why we learn dynamically,” said Oluwasogo, who went on to illustrate yoga moves best fitted for a person with disability.  Sewa Adeboye who had never wanted to be a dancer, said Heart Heartists gifted her with the skills of creating, self-confidence and leadership. “I learnt how to dance, choreograph dances, I lead one of the dance groups (it) founded in our (Saburi) community,” she said.  Still in awe, Attah Joy who performed at the opening said the hub did more than teach her how to dance. Attah had always desired to be an accountant, with visions of counting money every day. Since coming in contact with the hub, she said, “They built not only my flexibility. All I have lost in my life, I have gained through dance. I may not know specifically what I have gained but I know I have changed, I have grown, mentally, physically, and height-wise. People tell me I have grown taller since I started dancing professional. Now, besides dancing, I can do other things, like flower designs. I can create and do other things.”  Contrary to assumptions that having operated for over five years without a physical space, the latter is unnecessary with new age of remote work; but co-director, administrative and social engagement officer, David Olukitibi said artistes need the physical space to breathe, explore, research, experiment and experience.  “Sure, that can happen on the move, but (creatives) need a space where after doing their research, they can stay to work out their findings. We need a space not just for Heart Heartists but for a lot of creatives.  Activities happening at the hub include yoga, dance, traditional dance classes both for fitness and professionals. There are also training schedules for dancers, with several dance artistes holding their classes of their own to the hub.
