A women’s pressure group in Delta North senatorial district has declared support for billionaire lawyer, Ned Nwoko, the senatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic (PDP) in next year’s National Assembly (NASS) elections. The group’s president, Princess Mimi Peter said Nwoko enjoys wide acceptance because of his pedigree. Nwoko, a former member of the House of Representatives, is aspiring to the Red Chamber of the National Assembly on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party. Miss Peter, who made the call yesterday in Abuja said Nwoko had contributed to the development of Delta people and beyond. She said, “We need a voice in the Senate. Therefore, our people cannot afford to get it wrong this time round by electing someone who cannot give us quality representation. “If you look at the achievement of some persons who have represented us in the past, there is just little or nothing to show for it. Therefore, we should identify with our best for now by throwing our weight behind his aspiration. “His determination to end gas flaring if he gets to the National Assembly, for example, is instructive. If actualized, that singular act will create jobs for our teeming youths as companies will be there to harness the benefit that lies in ending gas flaring. “He has done a lot in the area of human development. The sports university he is building will help in reducing insecurity in the country.”
