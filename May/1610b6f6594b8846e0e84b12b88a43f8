A statement by the Bauchi Emirate Council Information Officer, Babangida Hassan Jahun, yesterday, described the news as not only fake, but also a figment of imagination of the reporter with the aim of tarnishing the image of the paramount ruler in Bauchi. The misleading news report, according to the Bauchi emirate council, is also geared towards causing confusion and disharmony among the citizenry of the state. To put the record straight, Jahun, quoted what the emir actually said, “I want to welcome you to Bauchi State. I believe you are in Bauchi for political activities but you still considered it necessary to visit me at this material time. This shows the love and respect you have for the traditional institution. “We believe that power belongs to Allah and he gives it to whoever he wants and at the same time, we are not politicians, we can’t participate in politics but we only advise wisely”. The emir concluded thus, “We pray that whatever you are here to do today in Bauchi State is fruitful. Whatever will bring unity and peace in our country is what we are after.”
