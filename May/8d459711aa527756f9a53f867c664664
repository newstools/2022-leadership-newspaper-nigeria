On the walls white walls of Orisun Gallery, and betwixt its metallic, cement and clay sculptures on display, hangs the 20 art pieces of multi-artist and part founder of the Zaria School of Arts Movement, Bruce Onobrakpeya. Sharing the walls of the gallery with Onobrakpeya and the star of exhibition are 22 oil paintings of Kanyeyachukwu Tagbo, a 13-year-old autistic art prodigy whose large colorful canvasses nearly outshines the brilliant copper, and oil paintings of the art icon. Entitled The Master & The Prodigy, the exhibition organized by the gallery aims at creating awareness on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) – a neuro-developmental disorder that affects a person’s social and communication abilities.  Reports indicate that about 1 in 100 people in the UK have autism; while about 1 in 54 children in the US are autistic. Therefore, autism is more common amongst populations than thought.  Research on the causes of autism is still ongoing. However, it has been proved that autism is not caused by a person’s upbringing or social circumstances. It is not curable rather a lifelong condition. This does not however mean that autistics cannot improve their learning and social skills over years through strategic interventions. Because it is a spectrum disorder, each person with autism is unique. Not everyone has every single symptom. People living with autism struggle with crowded places, noises, intense lights and sounds. Some find it hard to socialize, discern peoples’ expressions, or grasp simple and everyday words/phrases others take for granted. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-377719" src="//i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220507-WA0011.jpg?resize=450%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="450" height="600" srcset="//i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220507-WA0011.jpg?resize=450%2C600&amp;ssl=1 450w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220507-WA0011.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220507-WA0011.jpg?resize=750%2C1000&amp;ssl=1 750w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220507-WA0011.jpg?w=780&amp;ssl=1 780w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1"> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-377718" src="//i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220507-WA0012.jpg?resize=600%2C450&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="//i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220507-WA0012.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220507-WA0012.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220507-WA0012.jpg?resize=750%2C563&amp;ssl=1 750w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220507-WA0012.jpg?w=1040&amp;ssl=1 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1"> Some persons with autistic require little support while others require specialized support, and yet others are completely independent.  On the other hand, they are known to have areas of strong interest and sometimes, develop routines and sensory sensitivities. They are sometimes associated with strengths in the areas of visual memory, music, art, math and science.  Kanye falls among the few that have shown strong affinity for the arts. When he was diagnosed as autistic, his parents sought several activities to occupy his hyperactive nature. They tried soccer and swimming but none of these activities piqued his interest. It wasn’t until a friend suggested they enroll him in an art class, since he often scribbled with pencil and marker on paper, that they took him to an art teacher, then another art teacher, Kokab Faroukh. It was Faroukh who discovered his talent for the arts and offered to mentor him.  At 13 years, Kanye’s works had been exhibited in several international exhibitions, and his works hang in distinguished spaces such as the UNICEF headquarters in New York; the Nigerian Consulate in Vienna, Austria; and the presidential villa in Aso Rock. It is, however, the impact of art in his life that his parents appreciate more. Art, his father Tagbo Okeke said has not only kept his occupied, but aided his communication skills and theirs with him.  “Autistic children are hyperactive. When he is working on his art, it keeps him busy. At a time, he was non-verbal. Through art, he could communicate. And it takes one who loves art to appreciate whatever he was doing, and to understand what he was saying, because he was always saying a lot. He was always communicating.  “For us, my wife and I, we were trying to understand autism, and also trying to also understand art to be able to know what he is doing. That helped us in knowing how to encourage him. That helped us to know that at night when Kanye said he wanted to paint, rather than ask him to go to bed, we make available the materials for him to paint. We travel with canvas and paints because he would want to paint at any time. So, I see it more as him leading us to the arts rather than we discovering he could make art,” said Okeke.  With Kanye’s autism spectrum requiring need for specialized care, his parents are with him 24/7 or has two persons shadowing him at all times.  His father goes jogging with him three times a week, with Kanye sometimes riding his bicycle while his father jogs. They have a basketball coach play one-on-one games with him, although he is yet to develop the skills of playing with others. They also have an ABA instructor at the house to help with his studies.  All these aspects of private care and support are costly. Despite lack of governmental support, they draw strength and support from community of parents/guardians of children living with autism and other disabilities. They also share their own testimonies as a means of encouraging parents with children living with disabilities.  “We do whatever we can to encourage other parents because we are aware that many parents are living in denial, and so many of them don’t allow their children to come out or socialize. We know that it is a very difficult thing for parents too. Their underlying fear is “how will my child survive especially when I am gone?” said Okeke.  Speaking at the event, Onobrakpeya who just had an exhibition in New York, a retrospective spanning his works in the past 60 years, described Kanye as “a classic case of the successful inclusion of a child living with autism. He described the young prodigy as exemplary of the impact of art, home, society and government in the provision of adequate care and support for children with special needs.  “To be able to conquer autism and enable people living with autism live a fulfilled life, parents, society, and the government must work together to support them. The need for special care and attention for the autistic should be on the front-burner for all stakeholders of governance in our society, for adequate care of children with special needs. There must be legislation, policies to protect them. One of the ways we can do this is via public enlightenment and advocacy.  “Art as a tool for social orientation and transformation can be employed in capturing the attention of children living with autism. I have interacted with children living with autism at an institute I developed 24 years ago. I know the arts has a power to heal some of the effects of autism. I am encouraging parents and guardians to let their children attend art classes for pleasure or learning.”  He, however, cautioned parents to avoid exerting pressure on their gifted children so as not to rob them of their childhood. This is a good caution to throw out there because reports indicate that a large number of autistic persons are not prodigies. Every autistic person is not a Kanye.  Okeke couldn’t agree more.  Thus, he was quick to shutdown expectations on the outcome of Kanye’s becoming Onobrakpeya’s ward.  “We are honoured that he has taken Kanye as his ward. I don’t really expect anything. I am just trying to care for my son who has autism. I am not saying that in five or six years, this is what will happen. I am here by the grace of God. I am not here because we planned anything, because what Kanye is doing is not what he was taught. He does it on his own. The only plan I can tell you I have is to keep on caring for my son, and not neglect him.”  As exhibition winds to a close, three of Kanye’s artwork has sold, with a good number of works exciting the interests of later visitors to the gallery. My favourites and most decipherable pieces of his untitled works include: the painting of a giant smiley and triangular-legged pumpkin highlighted on a background of colorful geometric shapes; a red shell fish-like object that assumes the shape of an umbrella depending on the viewer’s perspective, and a bright yellow canvas with intricate white lines scribbled over what looks like a loopy cartoonish figure peeping into a huge microscope and a baby tumbling on a fluffy blue ball. These works are not only abstract, but a bit surrealistic and absurdist in nature. This is important considering that he creates as his father says “on his own, not what he is taught.” Such artistic freedom is priceless.  Hence, Onobrakpeya’s statement, “There is an artistic freedom which he displays that some people our age cannot. Some people of our age lack that freedom. We can learn from that. What he has done to me is that he has become one of my teachers.”  The Master & The Prodigy opened April 29 and formed part of global celebrations of the UN designed Autism Awareness Month.
