Ola who is seeking the party’s nomination to contest the House of Representatives seat from Ado/Irepodun/Ifelodun Federal Constituency, said such undemocratic conduct would be resisted through every legitimate means. The House of Representatives hopeful, however, called on the National Working Committee of the party to look into the complains and act accordingly. Addressing journalists in Ado Ekiti on Wednesday, Ola warned that the party must rescind its action to prevent a backlash during the June 18 governorship poll. Ola who accused some members of the State Working Committee of the party of manipulating the list in favour of a preferred aspirants, described it as the highest point of disappointment to members. “We are calling on the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee to intervene and call these people to order. How can you change the goal post in the middle of the game? They have to comply with the provisions of the law in arranging the primaries. “We are not expecting anything short of free, fair and credible primary. All aspirants must be given a level playing field that is the minimum the party can offer to all of us,” he said. The state chairman of the party, Hon Paul Omotoso, in his reaction assured the aspirants that the primary would be free, fair and credible and will be conducted in line with the party’s constitution and guidelines. Omotoso said many aspirants had raised such objection and that the party was investigating the accusation to be able to establish the veracity of the case. “We are investigating all these allegations. But let me say that the authentic delegates’ list will be released tomorrow from Abuja. “In case you don’t know, only Abuja can release it to us, the state has no such power,” Omotoso clarified.
