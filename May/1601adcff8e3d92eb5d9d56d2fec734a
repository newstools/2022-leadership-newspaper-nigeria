While briefing journalists on the preparations for the primary elections, the APC chairman in the state, Prince Sunday Fagbemi, said 1,930 delegates were expected to participate in the exercise. Fagbemi said that the state governor, AbdulRaman AbdulRazaq was returning unopposed. “Few incumbents including the state governor were returned unopposed. However, this does not exempt them from electoral process which requires them to be affirmed,” he said. The chairman added that primaries for the Senate and House of Representatives would hold on Friday and Saturday. He added: “Election shall hold for the state House of Assembly members at specific centres attached and all delegates are advised to set the specified centres for accreditation as early as 9:00 am. “For peaceful conduct of the exercise, all party members participating in the exercise must comply with laid down procedures as follows: non delegates should keep off venues of the election; delegates must conduct themselves in a decent and orderly manner devoid of any rancour or indecent rowdiness. “The party will not tolerate any form of indiscipline from candidates of their followers. Therefore, the use of thugs or ‘’good boys’ is prohibited; any aggrieved member should exhaust all windows of all opportunities available to them to make redress. “Aspirants shall be held responsible for any breach of peace and misconduct at the venue of the exercise.”
