Member representing Idah/Ibaji/Igalamela/Ofu federal constituency of Kogi State, Hon David Idris Zacharias has denied threatening Prince Enemona Audu, a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) with assassination. Describing the claim which was published in some news outlets as mischief taken too far, the lawmaker said the late Abubakar Audu’s son working in cahoots with some individuals were doing a hatchet job in order to distract him from the ongoing APC primary election processes. Reacting in a statement yesterday which he signed and made available to journalists, the lawmaker noted that Mr Audu was aware of his rising political profile since his assumption of office at the lower legislative chamber in 2019, hence, he resorted to blackmail and falsehood peddling to pull him down at all cost because of his own 2023 political interest. Zacharias said the field of politics is open, stressing that everyone is at liberty to test his popularity. The statement reads in part: “One of the greatest weapons of losers in every contest is their damage tactics with which they use to distract their competitors. Worst still, is the fact that people who lack capacity to effectively compete with their counterparts especially in political contests where they use blackmail, fake news, disinformation, propaganda and other tools to press home their points. “Unfortunately, this does not work with every person, especially those that had the singular opportunity to be politically tutored, natured, cooked, baked and mentored by one of Nigeria’s greatest and experienced political tactician of blessed memory, Prince Abubakar Audu, under whose tutelage Hon. David Zacharias acquired practical political and leadership orientation for several years of political apprenticeship.” The lawmaker stressed that he would have ordinarily ignored the publication, but for unsuspecting members of the public who didn’t know how Mustapha Audu has taken to an ungodly way in pursuing his political career, it became pertinent for him to outrightly deny all that he has alleged.
