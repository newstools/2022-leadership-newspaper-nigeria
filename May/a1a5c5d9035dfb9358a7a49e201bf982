Group under the aegis of Nigeria-First Foundation (Aka:JusticeNOW International), has appealed to delegates of all the political parties to consider competency as the only ingredient for electing leaders at their primaries ahead of the 2023 general elections. The former Inspector General of Police (IGP), Chief Mike Okiro, who is Board of Trustees (BoT) chairman of the group stated this at the world press conference titled, “Nigeria 2023 presidency, the emergence of party presidential candidates and the electorates decisions Credible Candidates not party base, key to the actualization of the ‘Next President of Nigeria” which held in Abuja. Okiro said, “The time to change the negative narrative of taking votes from villages and not transforming it into positive community development, is now. Consequently, the all awaiting 2023 Presidential elections unknown to many usually begins at party primaries. “For Nigeria today, the month of May 2022 is a unique and a decision making one at the political level, hence our decision to use the occasion the 19th monthly edition of the diplomatic and diaspora strategic stakeholders forum to specially appeal to the conscience of our delegates to be conscious of whom they elect to face the larger Nigeria people because the 2023 presidency begins effectively at these presidential primaries hence the need to present a Nigeria first oriented candidate being that the upcoming General Elections would be centered on credible candidate and not holistically party based.  “The message and mandate here is for our delegates to be nationalistic and very intentional as to whom gets their endorsement. No more business as usual. The delegates should also know that they are not only delegates of their respective political parties but also representing the Nigerian people all over the globe.  “Whatever they produce from the Party Presidential Primaries is what will determine the final decision of the electorates at the ‘Poll Unit’ where the God factor and conscience of the human mind would pay out this time, therefore Delegates are strongly advised going forward to vote the best aspirant to become their presidential candidate.”
