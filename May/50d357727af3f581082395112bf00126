The judge also ordered the forfeiture of a duplex belong to Ajewole, situated at Lekki, Eti-Osa local government area of Lagos State, worth over N60m and one RS 350 Lexus car worth more than N6m, which the convict procured with proceeds of his illegal activities, to the federal government. Ajewole was prosecuted alongside seven other fraudsters over similar offences by the Ilorin Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Others include Ebenezer Apata, Obadun Taofeek, Ayeni Kayode, Alade Daniel, Ojo Tobi, Adeyemi Segun and Akinrinmola Olumide. The convicts were among the 30 fraud suspects arrested by EFCC operatives during a sting operation in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State on April 26, 2022, except for Adeyemi Segun that was arrested in Ogbomosho, Oyo State sometime in October 2021. The convicts, who were prosecuted on separate charges, pleaded guilty to their respective charge. Delivering judgement on the cases, Justice Sani upheld the submissions of the prosecuting counsels and pronounced the defendants guilty of their respective charges. The judge, while sentencing the convicts to various jail terms, ordered the forfeiture of the items used as instruments of the crime and properties acquired with proceeds of crime by the convicts, to the federal government.
