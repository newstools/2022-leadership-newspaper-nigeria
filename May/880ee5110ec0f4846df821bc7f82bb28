The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has denied the sack of its governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele, describing the report as an unfounded rumour. It was rumoured yesterday morning that Emefiele had been sacked by President Muhammadu Buhari purportedly for his presidential ambition. The CBN said the online media reports purporting Emefiele’s sack was untrue. Head of Corporate Communications at the CBN, Osita Nwanisiobi, made the rebuttal on Wednesday in Abuja when he spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria. “I heard it just the way you got it too. As far as I am concerned, it’s a rumour. I’m not aware of any sack,” Nwasinobi said. Emefiele is currently out of the country on official assignment. The CBN governor has been under public scrutiny since he declared interest to run for the presidency at the oncoming 2023 general elections.
