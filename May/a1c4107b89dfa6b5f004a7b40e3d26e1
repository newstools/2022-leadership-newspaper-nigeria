T he direction of the Nigeria equities market for this week is expected to be uptrend despite the decline witnessed last week, as investors expect to focus on the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee(MPC) meeting. The MPC is expected to hold its third meeting of the year on the 23rd and 24th of May 2022. Analysts stated that, MPC may raise MPR to stabilise the external sector. According to them, “all in, we think the committee would retain the MPR at 11.5 per cent alongside other monetary policy parameters. However, we do not rule out the possibility of a 50bps hike in the MPR in light of the tightening of monetary policy by global central banks and the indirect impact of the Russia/Ukraine crisis on domestic inflationary pressures.” Analysts Optimism In the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited expect the domestic equities market to trade sideways as investors rebalance their portfolio in favour of high dividend paying stocks with good fundamentals. Cordros Capital Plc said: “in the week ahead, we believe investors will be focused on the outcome of the MPC meeting scheduled to hold next week to gain further clarity on the movement of yields in the fixed income (FI) market. “As a result, we envisage cautious buying actions from investors interested in cyclical stocks with attractive dividend yields. Notwithstanding, we reiterate the need for positioning in only fundamentally sound stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” The chief operating officer of InvestData Limited, Mr. Ambrose Omordion said: “we expect a mixed trend on increased positioning as the market reacts to impressive earnings of Presco and its corporate action, just as portfolio rotations while market players digest the macro-economic data and Q1 corporate earnings release, ahead of March year-end 2022 audited financials with dividend announcements to support uptrend in the new month amid the rebound in oil prices. “Also, the market continues to interpret the rising inflation in relation to the crude oil price and other factors, in the midst of profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing. This will result in market players targeting fundamentally sound and dividend-paying stocks in the hope of dividend announcements.” Last Week’s Trading Activities In line with analysts’ prognosis, the bears dictated proceedings in the local bourse as investors booked profits on bellwether stocks.
