Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development yesterday trained 80 civil societies organisations and non-governmental organisations on capacity building to monitor the implementation of the school feeding programme and ensure that the ministry has a transparent and open homegrown school feeding programme. The director, social development of the ministry, Taiwo Ademola Basolu said the ministry is building the capacity of civil societies organisations and non-governmental organisations on the implementation of the school programme in order to monitor the programme activities. He said the government aimed to deliver through the NHGSFP, a cost-effective school feeding programme, which seeks to develop the small holder farmer, whilst focused on guaranteeing food security in the beneficiary household. The consultant of the programme, Dr Grace Dafiel said the capacity building of NGOs is to ensure the ministry has a transparent and open home grown school feeding programme from the view of CSOs/NGOs in Nigeria. The consultant disclosed that this will help to improve the health outcomes and nutritional status of children in public pre-primary and primary schools, improve educational outcomes, encourage enrollment and retention of school age children. According to her, “We are currently training 80 participants from 34 states and FCT, adding that why it is 34 states is because Edo State has not yet connected with the plan.”
