A former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, on Monday, advised the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to postpone its presidential primary election. Omokri said Nigeria’s main opposition party should hold their primary election after the ruling All Progressives Congress’s presidential primary election. “If I will counsel the PDP, I would urge them to postpone their presidential primaries until the APC hold theirs. The APC is confused. That’s why they are talking of consensus. They want to choose their candidate based on who the PDP chooses. So, frustrate them!,” Omokri wrote on his verified Twitter handle. The PDP had fixed its primary election for May 28 and 29, while that of the APC has been scheduled for May 29 and 30. A total of 11,500 delegates selected from across the country would participate in the elections of the two parties. While the APC has 7,800, the leading opposition party has 3,700 delegates. Thirty-eight aspirants are in the race for the presidential tickets of the two leading parties. While the APC has 23, the PDP has cleared 15 aspirants to compete for its 2023 presidential ticket.
