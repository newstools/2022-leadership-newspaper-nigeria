Held at The Wheatbaker Hotel in Lagos, Nigeria, the brunch which is part of the eight days festivities for the eighth edition of the Africa Magic Viewers’ Choice Awards is one of the many ways the streaming platform is supporting local talent and spotlighting the growing popularity of online creators across the continent. Ahead of the event, content creators had the opportunity of showcasing their craft by entering the AMVCA Digital Creators Competition which entailed submitting a well-produced skit in any genre or topic of their choice. The entries were judged based on creativity, technical skills, comedic punch, message/theme, and performance. Other winners include Alison Precious for the most creative video and Evovo for the Best Theme. Both winners get a Masterclass at MultiChoice Talent Factory.
