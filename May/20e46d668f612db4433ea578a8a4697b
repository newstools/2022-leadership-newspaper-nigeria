The social media was awash yesterday with the ballot papers of the PDP for Gombe Central Senatorial District with a picture of Senator Goje as one of the contenders. Reacting, the ranking lawmaker, who chairs the Senate committee on Marine Transport, said he remains a loyal and proud member of the APC. A statement by his special assistant, Ahmed Isa, to this effect, noted: “The attention of his Excellency, Senator Danjuma Goje has been drawn to reports in the social media claiming that he took part in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Senatorial Primaries said to have taken place on Monday 23rd of May, 2022. “Sen Goje is a proud member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the serving Senator on the platform of the APC. He is not a member of the Peoples Democratic Party. He did not take part in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) primaries in Gombe for the position of Senator or any other position. “Senator Goje’s photograph on the PDP ballot paper is the work of mischief-makers and political opponents bent on tarnishing his image.”
