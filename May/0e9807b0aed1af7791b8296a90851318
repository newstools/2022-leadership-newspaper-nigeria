Over 200 ex-military men who fought during the Nigeria-Biafran Civil War, yesterday, staged a peaceful protest to register their grievances over the non-payment of their pensions in the past 44 years. The old men and women were seen on the streets of Ibadan with placards with various demanding inscriptions to show their agonies, calling on the President Muhammadu Buhari to look into their case. The retired military men and women took off from the Nigerian Legion Secretariat in Ibadan and marched through Yidi Gate through the NTA area, singing as they moved through the streets. Speaking, the National Coordinator of the discharged military personnel, Pa Babawande Philips, said it was unfair and inhumane to have paid former Biafran soldiers and abandoned those of them who fought on the side of Nigeria. Pa Philips said the ex-military men served directly under Buhari when he was in the military, saying he was sure that their former boss was not aware of their plights. He said, “We have been denied our pensions for the past 44 years and we have done everything to make them pay us but to no avail. “We have been to court and they asked us to drop the case. They called us for biometrics but to now say they will not pay us because we didn’t spend 15 years in the army is wicked.”
