Barely one month after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the establishment of 12 new private Universities in the country, one of the approved institutions, North-West University Sokoto, has been presented with an operational licence for the commencement of academic activities. Presenting the licence to the proprietor of the university and chairman, Northern Senators’ Forum, Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, said the establishment of such private Universities came at the right time when the nation was in dire need of more educational institutions. He said the establishment of the University, which was approved in April by FEC, shows the commitment of the Federal Government towards providing sound and quality tertiary education in Nigeria. Earlier, while recieving the licence/certificate, the proprietor of the North-West University Sokoto, Senator Wamakko expressed the readiness to continue with his efforts in bringing succour to the less-privileged in the society. He thanked the Federal Government, National Universities Commission (NUC) and all other stakeholders that contributed in ensuring the actualisation of the University. The presentation ceremony which attracted important personalities such as University Proprietors, members of the academic community, among others, was held at the Idris Abdulkadir Conference Hall of NUC in Abuja. Senator Wamakko was accompanied to the occasion by a former Nigerian Ambassador to the Republic of Tanzania, Sahabi Isah Gada, member of House of Representatives representing Wurno/Rabah federal constituency, Hon. Ibrahim Almustapha Aliyu, the secretary, planning and implementation Committee of the University and one-time Commissioner of Information in Sokoto State, Barrister Bello Muhammad Goronyo, and a former Commissioner of Fisheries and Animal Health, Alh.
