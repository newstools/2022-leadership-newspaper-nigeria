It was a bountiful harvest for the All Progressives Congress (APC) as more aspirants, including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, sealed their presidential ambition by picking the party’s presidential nomination and expression of interest forms pegged at N100 million. Others who paid N100 million to pick the forms include minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi; Lagos Pastor and former vice-presidential candidate, Pastor Tunde Bakare; former Senate president, Ken Nnamani, and Dr Nicholas Felix. The only female presidential aspirant, Barr Uju Ken Ohanenye, however, purchased her nomination and expression of interest forms with the sum of N39 million, as a beneficiary of the waiver granted women not to pay for nomination forms. This brings number of aspirants who have picked the APC presidential nomination forms so far to 12. Apart from Bakare and Nnamani, other presidential aspirants yesterday purchased their forms through their support groups and associates. A coalition of support groups led by Senate committee chairman on INEC and former Kano State governor, Senator Kabiru Gaya, picked the forms for Vice President Osinbajo. Gaya is chairman of The Progressive Project, TPP, an umbrella organisation of all support groups advocating the actualisation of a Yemi Osinbajo presidency in 2023. On his part, general overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, Nigeria, Tunde purchased N100m nomination and expression of interests forms to the growing list of aspirants scrambling for the APC presidential ticket Pastor Bakare who had in September last year claimed God told him he would be President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor in 2023, told journalists after picking his forms that he was in the race to contribute his quota to make Nigeria a cutting-edge nation. “Our programme is very simple: peace, progress, prosperity and possibilities. Upon those four pillars Nigeria will be rebuilt and the hope of many citizens would be rekindled. We are all going to join hands together to make it happen. No other nation will fix our nation, we will take Nigerians from all walks of life, within and without, those in disapora and those within to rise up and say it is time to rebuild our nation.” <img class="wp-image-377210 alignleft" src="//i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bakare-e1651759901636-600x565.jpg?resize=475%2C447&#038;ssl=1" alt="Osinbajo" width="475" height="447" srcset="//i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bakare-e1651759901636.jpg?resize=600%2C565&amp;ssl=1 600w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bakare-e1651759901636.jpg?resize=768%2C723&amp;ssl=1 768w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bakare-e1651759901636.jpg?resize=750%2C706&amp;ssl=1 750w, //i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bakare-e1651759901636.jpg?w=812&amp;ssl=1 812w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" data-recalc-dims="1"> On northerners contesting the presidential ticket of APC, he said it is not about South or North but God giving power to whoever He pleases. “God rules in the affairs of men; he gives it to whosoever He wills” Meanwhile, a United States-based Nigerian pastor, Nicholas Felix Nwagbo was among those obtained the expression of interest and nomination forms of the APC to contest the 2023 presidential election.
