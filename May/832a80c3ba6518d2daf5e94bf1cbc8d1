The National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA) is sending 200 young Nigerian farmers to undergo capacity building  in crop production and  animal husbandry in Israel and Morocco. The move is part of the federal government’s new ‘Aggressive Food Production’ programme aimed to boost food production and job creation. The  youths, who are drawn from the 36 states of the federation, will receive intensive training on greenhouse farming and animal husbandry for six days. Speaking during the official handing over of travel documents to the beneficiaries in Abuja yesterday, the executive secretary of  NALDA, Prince Paul Ikonne, explained that the capacity building programme was a continuation of the National Young Farmers Scheme, (NYFS) programme which President Muhammadu Buhari flagged off sometime ago. Prince Ikonne said this is a directive from  President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure that  youths are actively involved in food production, and make agriculture more attractive to them adding that  the training will expose and equip them on modern agriculture and agribusiness. According to him all expenses paid by the federal government as contained in NALDA’s budget, and they will be back to their localities to train other young people on NALDA’s integrated farm estates in their areas. He said, “The federal government is sending through NALDA 200 young farmers. It is a continuation of the National Young Farmers Scheme, NYFS, programme that Mr President flagged off and these 200 youths will be engaged in the process of learning proper crop production and greenhouse management, and 100 youth will be engaged in animal husbandry, slaughtering processing of meat. So we are sending them to countries that we know have strong expertise on what we are doing; Israel and Morocco, and this is to enhance their knowledge and to expose them to modern day practice in crop production and animal husbandry, so 200 young farmers would be sent for capacity building in Israel and Morocco”.
