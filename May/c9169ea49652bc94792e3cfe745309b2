Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Malam Muhammad Bello has appealed to members of the Dei-Dei building materials and adjoining markets’ communities to continue to maintain the peace following the unfortunate fracas that occurred last week. The minister who was represented by the FCTA permanent secretary, Mr Olusade Adesola, also appealed for the sustenance of the prevailing peace in the affected areas and prayed for the repose of the souls of the dead. Bello who stressed that an environment of peace and tranquility was very important for development, urged the entire FCT residents to see themselves as a big united family and work towards the attainment of a common objective of peace development. “It is our prayer that God would not allow this to happen again. The peace that we are building on, let’s continue to sustain it because it is very important for us. Just as we have seen, we are one. We have one objective, so let us build on it,” he said. The minister while speaking to the relations of the deceased victims, said,  “No matter what we give you, it cannot replace the lost lives. But we believe that the little token will, at least, show that the FCT loves you, feels your pains, and shares with you in this period of sorrow. We pray to God that we will not see this type of situation again.” Bello said Dei-Dei houses a major building materials market that attracts people from other states, decrying that shutting it down was in no one’s benefit but was imperative for restoration of peace. He said the reopening of the market would be looked into considering the prevailing peace in the area, charging residents to be mindful of those who wish to foment trouble in their midst and report them to security agencies.
