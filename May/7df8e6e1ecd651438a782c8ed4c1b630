Pastor Morrison, a member of Federation of International Basketball Associations (FIBA)’s technical committee was speaking at the conclusion of championship’s  round of 16, tagged “Sweet 16” He said the Mark D Ball Basketball tournament has raised the bar in the history of Nigeria basketball, noting that the gains achieved so far are unquantifiable. “Never in the history of Nigeria Basketball that a basketball championship would be so glamorous, elegantly packaged with a touch of panache. Officials and Players were happy with the organsation and I think the standard set will be difficult to march, reason being that we have upped the ante and the gains achieved are unquantifiable. Certainly, the round of eight (8) will be better and bigger,’ Pastor Morrison stated. After the one-week basketball fiesta, eight teams of 16 competitors qualified for the next round. The qualified teams are, Hot Coal Ballers, Nigeria Customs, FCT Hard Rockers,  Kwara Falcons, Mo Heat, Kano Pillars, Gombe Bulls and Delta Force.
