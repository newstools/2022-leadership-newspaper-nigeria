As the 2023 general election is fast approaching, an advocacy group called Pull-up Naija, is set to sensitise Nigerian youths to participate actively in the process and exercise their voting rights. According to film producer, Hauwa Allahbura, who is the Founder of Pull-up Naija, the group was a concept by the 24 Angels initiative borne out of the passion for increasing youth participation in the nation’s electoral process. In a press statement, the group said, “We are organising Holy grounds across six geo-political zones to build and sustain momentum for the upcoming elections and launching the first Holy ground in Lagos State, the Freedom Park at the Lagos Island “Our main goal is to drive youths to register, become active voters, and take their destinies in their hands.” The group’s enlightenment campaign will include measures the independent electoral commission has taken to ensure that all votes count. “While decade after decade Nigerian youth have been neglected to the background in terms of believing that their votes do not count, we want to change the perception. “We are breaking the myth that Our votes don’t count,” the group assured. With an aim to unite the youth, Pull-up Naija promised the availability of the youth to interact with their role models and captains of industries one on one. All the youth from different strata will be admitted to the great movement. The first major event is scheduled hold on May 21, 2022 at Freedom Park, Lagos as long as you are Nigerian Youth, it is free to attend and meet your role model and get inspired about our future in Nigeria and reason you should cast your vote during election. It said: “We are targeting the entrepreneurs, the bankers, the tech boys and girls, students, hawkers, the people who don’t get opportunities and access to interact withtheir mentors – young Nigerians who can’t afford to buy tickets to big shows and concerts.”
