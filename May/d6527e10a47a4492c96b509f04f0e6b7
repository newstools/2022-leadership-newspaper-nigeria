Some Katsina State elders have asked Governor Aminu Bello Masari to jettison his resolve to retire from active politics, after serving out his tenure as governor. They asked the governor to contest the Katsina South Senatorial seat in the forthcoming 2023 general elections. The elders under the auspices of Concerned Katsina Elders made the call while speaking with journalists in Kaduna on Tuesday. Leaders of the Concerned Elders, Alhaji Tajudden Bello and Alhaji Salisu Sheme said, Katsina and Nigeria cannot afford to lose experienced and patriotic politicians like Masari at a time their experience and expertise are most needed. According to Bello, “though we have not heard the governor saying it to our hearing, it is everywhere that, Governor Masari said he will retire from politics after his tenure as Governor. So, we are calling on him to jettison that idea if truly he has said so. “We know Governor Masari is an elder statesman, an upright politician who has foresight and the interest of the people at heart. These are the type of leaders this country desire at this time. “We are sure that, the people of Katsina looking at the achievements of Governor Masari, especially in the area of uniting the people and the numerous developmental projects he executed, even if he had made such statement, we the people of Katsina will go and drag him back into politics. “And because since his coming up, he had been in the service of the people and he listens to people. So, we are sure he will listen to the people of Katsina and heed to our call no matter the circumstance,” he said. Also speaking, Alhaji Salisu made a categorical call on the governor to jettison his retirement plan and contest the Katsina South Senatorial seat. According to Salisu, “there is no doubting the fact that, Nigeria needs elders with experience and patriotism like Masari in the National Assembly.
