A chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC) based in the United States of America Professor Emmanuel Dada has criticised the high cost of nomination forms sold by his party to aspirants, saying it would encourage corruption, when such aspirants get to office. Professor Dada whose initial plan was to run for Ekiti Central Senatorial seat said he had to withdraw from the race because the cost of the nomination form is astronomical high. He said, “Today, Wednesday May 11,2022 marks another sad day in the history of our country, Nigeria wherein we are witnessing the current unacceptable “money baggie” of Nigeria democracy where the nomination process has been sold to the highest bidders out of reach of ordinary Nigerians.” He maintained that when people buy forms at a high cost, there is the tendency of them stealing money to recoup what they have spent, because their entitlement for four years is not up to the cost of the nomination form. “There is no justification for these astronomical price tags and neither can it be rationalised,”  Dada said. He said restructuring of the country is inevitable, adding that, “There is the need to restructure the country, the high amount fixed for nomination form is a fraud, I can’t risk paying N20 million for Senatorial form and one would be told latter that the party has a candidate in mind for the race.’’
