A support group for Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi 2023 presidency, G-37, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to nominate the former minister of transportation as the party’s consensus presidential candidate ahead of the 2023 general election. The national coordinator of G-37, Comrade Evans City, made the call yesterday in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, in a good will message on the 57th birthday celebration of the former minister. Evans congratulated the minister saying he has paid his dues as a member of the governing APC. He recalled that the former minister had taken so many risks during the formation of APC and the eventual enthronement of President Buhari. According to him, as governor of Rivers State then, Amaechi narrowly escaped being lynched by supporters of then President Goodluck Jonathan, adding that one good turns deserves another. The G-37 national leader further disclosed that Amaechi remains the face of the APC in the South South zone, adding that the party stands at a great advantage of retaining power at the centre if the former minister is given the APC ticket to run for the 2023 presidency.
