A former governor of Enugu State, Senator Chimaroke Nnamani and incumbent governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, have won the senatorial primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the State.  Nnamani defeated a former Chief of Staff, Ifeoma Nwobodo, at the primary election held at Agbani with 243 votes, while Ugwuanyi defeated Eze Godwin with 299 votes to pick the ticket for Enugu North senatorial zone.  The governor picked the ticket at the primaries held on Tuesday at the Nsukka Stadium in Nsukka local government area of the state.  Announcing the results, the returning officer, Yandev Ammabai, said Ugwuanyi polled 299 votes to defeat his closest rival, Eze Godwin who scored 16 votes while Godsmack Ugwu and Okanye Celestine recorded zero votes.  The primary election, which witnessed large turnout of supporters of all the aspirants, was conducted on Tuesday after it was shifted from Monday due to the Monday’s sit-at-home order in the South-East.  The governor is seeking to replace Chukwuka Utazi, the incumbent Senator representing Enugu North.  Enugu North senatorial district consists of six LGAs: Nsukka, Udenu, Igbo-Eze North, Igbo-Eze South, Igbo Etiti and Uzo-Uwani.
