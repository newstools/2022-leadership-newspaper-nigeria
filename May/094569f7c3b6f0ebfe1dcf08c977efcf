A non-governmental organisation (NGO), the AISH Initiative, has called for more awareness and capacity building for members of communities to prevent and respond to gender-based violence (GBV) issues. The executive director of AISH Initiative, Mrs Helen Nwoko, made the call at a one-day sensitisation to stop GBV, at Karu, FCT. She said, “We believe that the rate of gender-based violence can be reduced in the community through increased awareness of the behaviour, beliefs and actions that encourage these terrible actions as well as strengthening the capacity of community members to respond and prevent gender-based violence issues. “This requires our collective effort in the Karu community.’’ Nwoko, however, identified individual factors, including hostility towards women and a history of sexual abuse as a child as part of the factors perpetuating the instances of GBV in the country. She also blamed the hindrances to eradication of GBV in the country on what she described as legal factors. “These factors include the Nigerian government’s failure to adopt most international conventions on human rights,” she added. Representative of the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs, Mr Nwabueze Emeka, stressed the need for every home to guide against child abuse. The Sakaruyi of Karu, Dr Emmanuel Yepwi, noted that a lot of GBV cases were presented to the palace and that they were doing their best to handle the cases. Represented by a district head, Chief Atnadu Shanyibwa, the royal father said the palace often refers GBV cases that are beyond the administration of the palace to the police.
