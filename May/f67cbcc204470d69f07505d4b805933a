He expressed appreciation to the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration for the enormous support and boost to the NIS. The minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, on his part, urged the new recruits to guard the nation’s border jealously and thus, boost all security measures at attaining that challenge. He charged the cadets to chart a career path of honour, integrity and dignity as they begin a significant aspect of their lives, noting that those virtues are indispensable. Aregbesola said, “Without secure borders, no security measure can work because external criminally-minded persons can infiltrate the country and escape at will if the borders are not well secured.” Giving a breakdown of the gender of the 548 cadets, who passed out of the training school after a six-month period of physical drills and academic training, the statement revealed that 132 were females while 416 were males.
