Trading activities for this week will be a short one on the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited as the federal government declared Monday, May 2 and Tuesday, May 3, 2022 as public holidays to mark the Worker’s Day and Eid-el-Fitr celebrations. Analysts maintain that the Nigerian stock market will continue its positive trend, as the market enters trading for the month of May and on the influx of better than expected first quarter (Q1) corporate earnings, as investors take advantage of the numbers to position.  Analysts Optimism In the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited expected the equities market index to rise further as investors buy more shares in anticipation for the Q1, 2022 companies release. Analysts at Cordros Securities Limited said: “in the week ahead, we expect investors to continue to rotate their portfolios towards cyclical stocks that delivered decent earnings last week. “Thus, we see scope for the bulls to maintain dominance, albeit the magnitude of the gains will be substantially lower, as profit takers are likely to cash out on the gains across bellwether stocks. Notwithstanding, we reiterate the need for positioning in only fundamentally sound stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” On market outlook, GTI Securities Limited said: “transactions on the market ended positively as the bullish trend persists, propelled by investors increased buying interest in both medium and large stocks and impressive Q1, 2022 results of some companies. We expect a continuity of this trend as the week rounds up for the Islamic break.” The chief operating officer of InvestData Consulting Limited stressed that, “we expect the positive trend to continue on the influx of better-than-expected Q1 corporate earnings, as market players take advantage of these numbers to position as investors digest the Q1 numbers and 2021 full-year earnings reports, ahead of March year-end 2022 audited financials with dividend announcements to support uptrend in the new month and oscillating oil prices.”  Last Week’s Trading Activities Impressive corporate earnings by bellwether stocks supported market performance last week, as investors increased their bets on blue-chip companies in anticipation of continued expansion in profits. Notably, investors’ buying interest in Nigerian Breweries, Seplat Energy, Lafarge Africa, Guinness Nigeria and Unilever Nigeria supported market performance.
