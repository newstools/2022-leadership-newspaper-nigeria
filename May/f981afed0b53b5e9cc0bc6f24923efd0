The All Progressives Congress (APC) has slated the screening of its presidential aspirants for Tuesday, May 24, 2022. National organising secretary of the party, Suleiman Argungu, who gave the hint on Monday, said the party will be screening the presidential aspirants, who obtained nomination forms, on Tuesday, May 24, and Wednesday, May 25 at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel in Abuja. The party had on Sunday postponed the screening for a second time after it failed to hold last weekend without giving any reason for the shift. LEADERSHIP, however, learnt that it may not be unconnected with ongoing efforts to prune the number of presidential aspirants seeking the party’s presidential ticket. The party also rescheduled it primaries for the House of Representatives to now hold on Saturday, May 28, 2022, instead of May 26 alongside with the governorship primaries. Presidential aspirants who submitted their nomination forms include Vice President Yemi Osibanjo; APC national leader, Bola Tinubu; former President Goodluck Jonathan; former minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and former minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Sen. Godswill Akpabio. Others are Cross River State governor, Ben Ayade; Ebonyi State governor, Dave Umahi; Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi; former minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba and former Senate President, Sen. Ken Nnamani. Others include Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello; his Jigawa State counterpart, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar; former Zamfara State governor, Ahmed Yerima; former minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu; former Imo State governor, Rochas Okorocha and former Ogun state governor, Sen.
