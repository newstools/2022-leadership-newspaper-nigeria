At the secondary bond market, the bulls dominated the Treasury bonds market as the average yield across instruments declined by 10bps to 11.2 per cent. Analysts attributed the bullish sentiment to investors covering for lost bids at the FGN bond auction which was held last week Monday. Across the benchmark curve, the average yield contracted at the short (-2bps) and mid (-27bps) segments as investors sold off the MAR-2027 (-17bps) and NOV-2029 (-34bps) bonds, respectively; but expanded at the long (+2bps) end following investors’ profit-taking activities on the APR-2037 (+27bps) bond.
