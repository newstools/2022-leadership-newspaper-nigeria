Heading into the final day of the season, Liverpool needed to beat Wolverhampton Wanderers and hope Man City fail to beat Aston Villa managed by former Reds skipper Steven Gerrard. But at the end of the dramatic final day, with less than 20 minutes left , Gerrard and Villa could not hold on as Man City came from 2-0 goals down to win 3-2 and retain the league title. Liverpool also had to come from a goal down to beat Wolves 3-1 but it was not enough for Jurgen Klopp’s men. Man City ended the season on 93 points after 38 games, just one point ahead of Liverpool. At the Emirates Arsenal thrashed Everton 5-1 but it was too little too late, as they were pipped to the last Champions League place by North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur. A win for Arsenal against Everton while a defeat for Spurs at already relegated Norwich, would have seen them qualify for a first Champions League since 2017. But Spurs hammered Norwich 5-0 at Carrow Road to beat their bitter rivals and claim fourth place while Arsenal finished fifth. And in the relegation fight, Leeds stayed up after beating Brentford 2-1 away while Burnley dropped down no thanks to a 2-1 home loss to Newcastle United.
