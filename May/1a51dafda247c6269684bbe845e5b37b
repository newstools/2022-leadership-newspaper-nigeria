Another annoying thing I want to say about some of these taxi services is that some of the car owners or drivers can so waste your time! Some will even cancel and tell a lie that they arrived your location but you did not show up. And why does this always seem to happen when you need to be somewhere urgently or when you are stranded? It beats me! The good thing is that there is an actual record of their whereabouts and locations and you can actually complain to the service provider and request for matters to be looked into. Some will tell you they need the bonus or they would be penalised for just canceling a ride. And funny thing is, they are the ones who can’t come to pick you and not the other way round. You can’t eat your cake and have it peeps, it doesn’t always work that way! Maybe a few times I have indulged some of them and canceled the trips that they could not make, but this can’t be the case all the time. If you don’t want to get penalised then in that case do the right thing! Be accountable and transparent, at this point I shouldn’t even be telling you to wear your work ethics like a crown! You should know this ! It will go a long way to boost your bonuses and make you a star employee.
