Meanwhile, there was jubilation by the locals in Etim Ekpo, over the killing of the cult leader, who, according to them had usurped the powers of several village heads in Etim Ekpo, especially Obong clan. “He used to hold court and administer judgment of people in his palace. If a husband err, according to his ruling, you will be flogged by your wife and fine imposed on you. If you are not able to pay the fine, your property would be seized. It is a big relief for us in Obon Ebot village because the village can no longer preside over cases,” Imaobong Akpan, a resident told journalists. “He was in the habit of raping people with his gang members and most of his activities were encouraged by our local politicians here, who used him against political opponents in election season like this,” Eteudobong Inyang, one of the jubilant locals also said. A village head, who would not want his name in print, lamented that, “I have been chased away from my palace several times by these gangsters. “They would stop harvesting of the village palm trees for a year. After that Oto will order his gang members to harvest them and sold to village women with all the proceeds seized.” He, therefore, urged Governor Udom Emmanuel to ensure the dreaded confraternities in the state are completely outlawed. Recall that Governor Emmanuel had since 2019 placed a ban on no fewer than 64 cult groups operating in the state and amnesty granted to several of them, who came out of the bushes, renounced cult membership and dropped their arms for government’s sponsored vocational jobs.
