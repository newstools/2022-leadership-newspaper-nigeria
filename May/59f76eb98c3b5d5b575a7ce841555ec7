At least eight villagers have been killed and a military base set ablaze when Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists attacked a remote village in Chibok local government area of Borno State. LEADERSHIP gathered that the terrorists stormed the Kautikari village in their numbers at about 7pm Tuesday night and started shooting sporadically. According to a source, the corpses of the victims were recovered from bushes while two persons were burnt. The Vigilante source said, “We have recovered eight lifeless bodies from the scene of yesterday’s attack on our village (Kautikari), many are still unaccounted for as they are still missing. “The military base was completely burnt down and some residential homes equally touched.” LEADERSHIP reports that Chibok has been under incessant attacks since the invasion of Chibok Secondary School in 2014 by the Boko Haram terrorists, who abducted over 200 schoolgirls afterwhich some of them escaped and others were rescued. Apart from the abduction of the schoolgirls that attracted wide condemnations across the world, the insurgents have continued with attacks and abductions in the Chibok communities, with houses burnt and livestock and foods stolen by the marauding criminals. The Borno State governor, Prof. Babagana Umara Zulum, had recently decried the increasing presence of ISWAP terrorists in the southern part of the state where Chibok is located as well as northern part of Borno.
