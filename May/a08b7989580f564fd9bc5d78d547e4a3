Nwawuba, seeking a third term through the PDP, announced his withdrawal via a letter addressed to the state chairman of the party dated May 24, 2022. According to him, the primaries is riddled with unfair practices and lack of level playing ground. He said “Due to unfair practices and lack of a level playing field in the organization of the 2023 primary elections in my constituency, I write here to formally withdraw my participation in the primary elections scheduled for May 25.My withdrawal is premised on the lack of transparency in the generation of the delegates list and the failure of the party to adhere to its guidelines as well as those of the Independent National Electoral Commission. Please consider this for the records that I am not a contestant in this predetermined charade”, he stated. The House Committee chairman on legislative agenda also copied the state PDP House of Representatives Electoral panel, the National Chairman and Secretary of the party. Allegations of hijack has riddled the PDP primaries in the state as aspirants claim that the positions had been divided between the party’s National Secretary, Senator Samuel Anyanwu and erstwhile Governor, Rt Hon Emeka Ihedioha, and some other party stalwarts. As a result, areas ceded to loyalists of any of the political warlords are automatically displaced while the preferred candidates are to be given a smooth sail.  Despite notices of primaries in the state, aspirants and delegates were unsure of the venue, even as they kept moving from the three designated venues without any official in sight as at 4pm on Wednesday.  Party faithful besieged the Okigwe Road state Secretariat, the Kanu Nwankwo sports centre, and the Aladinma shopping mall in hundreds even without any information.
