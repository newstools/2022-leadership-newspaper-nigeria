In a statement by KCTA legal adviser, Abdul’Aziz Muhammad, yesterday, the agency said to restore the aesthetics of the defaced structures, its monitoring and enforcement team has embarked on a removal exercise as the first line of action to ensure the continued maintenance of these infrastructures. The statement warned that, subsequently, violators, including organisations, aspirants, and individuals, will be penalised according to the provisions of extant state laws and regulations. The statement reads in part: “We are mindful of the activities that depict the campaign season and the need for support groups to showcase their desired candidates. However, this act of solidarity should not be to the detriment of the newly rehabilitated city infrastructures. “Therefore, the use of adhesive to place posters and the writing on public infrastructure is vehemently discouraged. As an alternative, polymer, vinyl, polyethylene banners, billboards, flyers, handbills/pamphlets, brochures, calendars, notebooks, and branded souvenirs should replace posters.” “Finally, residents of Kaduna city must work together to preserve the exemplary work of the Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, and ensure that Kadcity remains the choice place to live, work, and play,” the statement added.
