Colleges of Education Academic Staff Union (COEASU), North Central Zone, has threatened to embark on industrial action if the federal government fails to address the union’s demands. The union made the threat yesterday in a statement signed by its vice president and zonal coordinator, Mr Noah Danlami, in Kaduna. It cautioned the federal and state governments that failure to address the legitimate demands with the urgency they deserve would cripple the college of education system in the country. COEASU stressed that the inaction of the government would leave all colleges of education in the zone with no option than to participate in any industrial action declared by its national body. “COEASU North Central zone hopes that government at all levels and other critical stakeholders in the education sector will not allow the situation to degenerate to industrial disharmony. “This will be counterproductive to the realisation of the laudable goals for which Colleges of Education were established and the general growth and development of the education sector of our nation,” the union said. The National Executive Council (NEC) of the union had on May 11, 2022, given the federal government a 21-day ultimatum to meet its demands or face an industrial action. Some of the lingering issues according to the union include reluctance of the federal government to renegotiate the 2010 Agreement and the refusal to adopt UTAS platform for payment of salaries of universities and other tertiary institutions. There is also the refusal of the federal government to release the N15 billion pledged revitalisation fund made in 2019, in addition to the N478 billion outstanding Presidential Needs Assessment Fund Agreement. Another issue is the poor funding of colleges of education and poor conditions of service for state owned colleges, especially colleges in the North Central Zone.
