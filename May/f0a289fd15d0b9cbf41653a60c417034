National chairman of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) Chief Dan Nwanyanwu yesterday commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the Federal Executive Council (FEC) for directing all political appointees interested in contesting any elective office in 2023 to resign on or before Monday 16. This came a week after the NEC of ZLP called on the president to ask such appointees to resign. He said “This is President Muhammadu Buhari I know that listens. This decision is supported by morality and conscience.”
