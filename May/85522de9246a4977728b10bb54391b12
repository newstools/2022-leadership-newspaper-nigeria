President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed his commitment to seeing only candidates with integrity prevail in next year’s general elections. The President disclosed this when he received an All Progressives Congress (APC) aspirant vying for the Kano Central senatorial seat in Kano State, Senator Basheer Lado. The president also restated his commitment to peaceful and fair elections in 2023. Speaking to State House correspondents after he met with the President, Senator Lado said: “As you are aware, Kano State is the largest producer of votes in Nigeria. “It is the decider of who becomes the next president in the presidential election. “Just like my Governor Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has done in the past, I respectfully informed and reassured Mr President that the APC is still the party to beat in Kano despite recent defections.” According to him, President Buhari declared his commitment to credible elections that would ensure the emergence of candidates with integrity. “After my briefing, Mr. President reiterated his commitment to credible and peaceful elections and also his desire to see candidates with integrity prevail at the polls all across Nigeria,” Lado said.
