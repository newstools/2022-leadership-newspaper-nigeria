A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, has ordered the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to show reasons why the party’s gubernatorial primaries should hold in Rivers State without one of its governorship aspirants, Hon Doctor Farah Dagogo. Dagogo, who is currently being detained at the Port Harcourt Maximum Security Correctional Centre, on the orders of a Rivers State High Court, had last week dragged PDP and INEC to court following the removal of his name from list of governorship aspirants to participate in the party’s primaries. The plaintiff had gone to court in Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/654/2022, to seek an order of the High Court to restrain INEC, (2nd Defendant) or any of its officers or agents from monitoring the conduct of the PDP (1st Defendant) primary election for the gubernatorial position for Rivers State scheduled for 26th May 2022. The court headed by Hon. Justice Taiwo Taiwo, ordered the PDP and INEC to show cause on May 24, 2022 why the detained governorship aspirant’s application seeking injunctive orders against the two defendants, in respect of the PDP gubernatorial primary election for Rivers State should not be granted. Dagogo had asked the Court not to allow INEC to send any of its representatives on the scheduled fixed date without his name on the list of contestants for the forthcoming primary election pending the hearing and determination of the substantive action. The PDP governorship aspirant is also appealing to the court to compel INEC and PDP, to include his name as one of the aspirants in the forthcoming gubernatorial primary election. The aspirant is seeking “an order of interlocutory injunction restraining the 2nd Defendant either by itself or any of its officers or agents from monitoring the conduct of 1st Defendant’s primary election for the gubernatorial position for Rivers State on 26th May, 2022 or any other date fixed, without the name of the plaintiff on the list of contestants for the said primary election pending the hearing and determination of the substantive action.”
