The source said that some uncomfirmed number of the terrorists were killed during the troops agressive incursion into the terrorist hideouts as many of them fled, abandoning their belongings and logistics.  The sources added that the ongoing regional combined sustained operations as well as airstrikes and heavy artillary bombardments by  troops of Desert Sanity and MNJTF’s Lake  Sanity have exerted so much pressure on the terrorists and totally disoriented them.
