There is apprehension in Agbor, Ika South local government area of Delta State over the overwhelming presence of stern-looking security operatives. The presence of the army, police and other operatives may not be unconnected to the collapse of the perimeter fence of the Nigeria Correctional Services (NCS), Agbor, during Monday’s downpour in the area. Locals claimed that scores of inmates at the correctional facility escaped as a result of the collapsed wall before the situation was brought under control with the deployment of a combined team of gun wielding security operatives. While residents expressed anxiety and adamant some inmates escaped the command stated that no inmate escaped from the facility. “At the moment, there is heavy security presence. People are now very cautious in Agbor, ” the source said. The public relations officer of the NCS in the state command, Allen Iloba, who confirmed the collapse of the wall to our correspondent in Asaba, also said no casualty was recorded as a result of the incident. He said the windy storm that blew off the fence occurred at about 4.pm when the inmates had been locked up in the cells. “When there is such a storm, we usually lock up the inmates. So they had already been locked up in their cells, and when the rain came with the terrible storm, the left side of the perimeter fence gave way, it fell down. The inmates were in their cells when the fence fell. “Men have been drafted, we have men of the Nigerian Army on ground. We equally have operatives of the Nigerian Police Force, to complement the efforts and number of our personnel. “We also have the conventional staff that you know before, they are on ground. That place is properly covered, the security there is water-tight. Everything is under control, we are on top of the situation,” he said.
