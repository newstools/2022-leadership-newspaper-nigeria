Uzoho came under intense criticism after he committed a blunder in Nigeria’s 1-1 home draw against West African arch rival Ghana in a 2022 FIFA World Cup playoffs in March. Although the Super Eagles rallied back with defender William Troost-Ekong equalising from the penalty spot, they were eliminated on away goal rule. There were reports in the media on Monday that Uzoho, who was left out of Nigeria’s squad for the upcoming friendlies against Mexico and Ecuador has quit international football. The former Deportivo La Coruna star has however poured cold water on the speculation. “I’m committed to playing for my dear country anytime I’m called up,”Uzoho told the Super Eagles media team. The 23-year-old has 18 caps for the Super Eagles.
