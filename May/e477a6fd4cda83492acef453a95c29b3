The schools are resuming on the trail of the Ramadan fast and Eid-el-Fitr celebrations. The executive chairman of Bauchi State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) Dr Abubakar Surumbai Dahiru Bauchi said this in a chat with LEADERSHIP Friday in Bauchi. He said it is annoying that despite the efforts being made by the state government to provide conducive atmosphere for teaching and learning in all schools across the state, unscrupulous teachers are still not motivated to deliver on their official responsibilities. The chairman said he went around some schools in Bauchi metropolis and other parts of the state for an on-the-spot assessment of the level of resumption in all public schools in the state. He said the board will not spare any teacher found wanting, warning teachers to ensure that they report to their places of primary assignments on time to avoid coming under the hammer of the board. Surumbai mandated education secretaries in the 20 local government areas of the state to closely monitor the resumption of both teachers and students in their domain and report the same to the board. He warned parents and guardians to send their wards to the classes. “Just like teachers, any defaulting child will not be spared,” he said. “The extension of resumption date of schools under the state ministry of education does not affect schools under SUBEB,” he said. LEADERSHIP Friday’s visit to one of the schools within the metropolis revealed that only four pupils resumed and some teachers.
