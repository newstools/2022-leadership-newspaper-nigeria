Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has procured the expression of interest and nomination forms of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to contest the presidential ticket of the party for the 2023 elections, sealing his bid as presidential aspirant on the platform of the governing party. This is even as Pastor Tunde Bakare of the Citadel Global Community Church Lagos on Thursday paid N100million to purchase the presidential expression of interest and nomination forms of the APC ahead of his declaration to contest for the 2023 presidency on Monday at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Centre, Abuja. While Bakare was at the International Conference Centre (ICC) Abuja, to personally pick his forms, Vice President Osinbajo’s forms were purchased for him by his support groups led by Senator Kabiru Gaya at the ICC.  Confirming the development on his verified Twitter handle, senior special assistant to the Vice President on media and publicity, Laolu Akande, wrote: “A passionate team of support groups and individual Nigerians from across the country have raised funds to support the purchase of APC nomination forms for the Vice President’s 2023 presidential bid. Today, the forms are being collected by representatives of the team, just as the VP continues his interactions with APC stakeholders across the States. “Today, he is in Cross River and Bayelsa States. It’s all about the VP’s desire to serve the people of Nigeria with all his heart, his experience, insight and knowledge.”
