Some Nigerians have offered a special prayer in the holy Mosque in Madinah, Kaaba in Mecca for peace and development of Nigeria and to ask Allah to choose Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello as the next Nigerian President in the 2023 election. The chairman of a group, Youth Movement for Yahaya Bello, Alhaji Salihu Magaji, who also organised the prayer, said in a telephone interview with journalists, they had offered a special prayer for the victory of Yahaya Bello’s bid for the country’s presidency. He said, “It is Allah that gives powers to whomever he wishes and we will continue to pray for Yahaya Bello so that he should continue to do his bit and what is required to be selfless as a leader and particularly, to do a lot of youth-driven programmes. “He is trying his best so far so good but what is critical is may God continue to keep him, bless him and bless all his works. He is someone that I have known for so many years. I have a very good relationship with him and we would continue to pray for him. It is not all about money, it’s about the genuine future of our country Nigeria,” Magaji said. He promised to maximise the opportunity provided to pray for the peace, blessing and development of Nigeria, “We equally prayed for Nigeria to be a much better country in terms of good governance and better citizenry and to give Yahaya Bello the opportunity to lead Nigeria and address all its lingering problems.”
