Analysts have maintained a positive outlook for the Nigerian equities market this week, as investors search for stocks with good fundamentals and positive returns. They noted that buying interest and positive sentiments may continue in the face of a high-volume movement and increased positioning in blue chips on the strength of their earnings power. “Tentatively, the continued mixed direction of fixed income market yields and treasury bill (TB) rates may continue supporting the flow of funds into equities, on strong demand for stocks in this prevailing uptrend and positive sentiment amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine that has influenced the global markets in recent times,” they said. In the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited expect the equities market index to rise further as investors buy more shares in anticipation of more positive first quarter (Q1), companies’ release. Cordros Securities Limited said: “Given that the Q1, 2022 earnings season has run its course and the upward repricing of cyclical stocks that ensued, we expect a subdued market performance in the week ahead. “The bears will likely dominate market performance, as investors cash out on the gains across bellwether stocks over the past two weeks. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Afrinvest Limited added that, ‘in the coming week, we expect gains to taper on the back of mild profit-taking.’ Last Week’s Trading Activities Despite the shortened trading session last week, the local bourse extended its bullish run to four weeks, driven by investors’ positive reaction to the impressive Q1, 2022 earnings.
