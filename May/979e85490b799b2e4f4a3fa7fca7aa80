The governor in a statement signed by his special assistant on media and publicity, Bala Dan Habu expressed worry about the fate of the commanding officer of the Battalion who was declared missing after the operation. Ishaku said the attack on civilians and police officers in Takum which prompted the response of the soldiers from the 93 Battalion had proved that the bandits had become even more desperate than ever to kill and to maim innocent people. The governor praised the gallantry soldiers led by the commanding officer of the battalion for reacting promptly to the distress calls by the people of the areas under the siege of the bandits. He regretted that the operation resulted in the unfortunate death of six military officers and the uncertainty over the whereabouts of the commanding officer. Ishaku on behalf of himself and the people of the state commiserated with the military, the immediate and extended families of the deceased military officers and urged Nigerians to also pray for the safe return of the commanding officer of the battalion. Governor Ishaku used the opportunity to renew his calls on the people of the state to be vigilant and to always monitor strangers coming into their communities. He prayed to God to grant the souls of the deceased soldiers’ eternal rest.
