Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, who represents Abia South in the National Assembly, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Abaribe consequently resigned his position in the Senate as Minority Leader. The lawmaker, who was one of the top contenders for the PDP governorship ticket in Abia State, pulled out of the primary about 78 hours to the exercise. He confirmed his exit from the PDP and as a Minority Leader of the Senate in separate letters to the PDP Ward chairman in Obingwa local government area of the State and the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan. He cited illegality, impunity and hesitations in decision-making as reasons for his decision to quit the PDP. He, however, did not say which party he will join, a decision he said, will be communicated to the public soon. A letter sighted by our correspondent and addressed to the party’s ward chairman in Obingwa LGA, titled “Resignation of My Membership from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP,” reads in part, “I write to inform you of my decision to resign as a member of (the) Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “This development is consequent upon the shameful display of illegality, impunity and undemocratic decision of the party and after due consultations with my constituents.”
