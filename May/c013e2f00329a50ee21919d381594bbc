The outlawed separatist group, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has reacted to the beheading of a military couple in Imo State, denying involvement in the murder.  IPOB in a statement on Wednesday signed by its spokesperson, Emma Powerful, disclosed that the group has no hand in the killing.  The statement reads; “Our attention is drawn to the laughable and fallacious statement credited to the Nigeria Army that IPOB is responsible for the killing of a couple on transit in Imo State after their marriage ceremony.  “We, therefore, wish to place on record that IPOB has no hands in the said atrocity which is an abominable act in Igbo tradition. No true Igbo will hurt an in-law, how much more a married daughter (Ada) in Igbo land. Even the ancestors will avenge such wickedness.  “We cannot kill our sister who is about to marry but those who killed them were those Nigerian government and its security agencies, especially the military and DSS created to demonise IPOB and ESN.  “These agents of death some of whom we have made their identities public severally are behind the killings of these soldiers, not IPOB or ESN operatives.”
