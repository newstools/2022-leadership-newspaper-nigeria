A senatorial aspirant under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Cross River Central, Barr. Mary Ekpere-Eta, has promised to prioritise women and youth empowerment if elected into the Red Chamber come 2023. Ekpere-Eta, who outlined her plans for bringing development to her senatorial district after submitting her nomination forms on Wednesday evening, also said she will ensure that she attract infrastructural projects to her district. She said: “I joined the race for the sole purpose of pulling more of my people out of poverty. As you already know, youth and women empowerment is critical to achieving this. “Also critical to reducing the level of poverty among our people will be by attracting infrastructural projects in the education and health sectors as well as basic infrastructure and even in the area of rural electrification.” Ekpere-Eta, who is a former Director-General of the National Centre for Women Development (NCWD), expressed confidence that she will clinch the ruling party’s ticket. “I have consulted leaders, women and youth leaders within the APC from ward to local government, up to the state level and they expressed their support for my aspiration. “I have also taken my consultations beyond the party. I have been meeting with our respected traditional rulers, community leaders, the clergy, women leaders as well as our young people. I can tell you the response from these groups has boosted my confidence,” she stated.
