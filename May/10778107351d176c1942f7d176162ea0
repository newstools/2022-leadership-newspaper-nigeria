Taraba Patriotic Front, a civil society group advocating for good governance and transparency in Taraba State, has called on the national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to properly scrutinize documents being submitted by former deputy governor of the state, Abubakar Sani Danladi, to contest for Taraba North senatorial district in the 2023 elections. In a statement made available to journalists in Abuja yesterday, coordinator of the Taraba Patriotic Front, Wayas Benjamin said the former deputy governor should be disqualified from running if the ruling party must record success in the general elections in the state warning that he has been parading forged documents. “I strongly believe that disqualifying Abubakar Sani Danladi from contesting the election is in the best interest of not only the APC, but Taraba State, because he has been in and out of court several times on issues of dishonesty, false declaration and lying on oath as relates to the information contained in the affidavit supporting his personal particulars submitted to INEC,” Benjamin said. According to him, Danladi was petitioned in court in 2007 and 2018 when he contested as deputy governor to late Danbaba Suntai and when he was presented by the APC governorship candidate over issues bordering on his educational qualification. He also cited how the APC lost out in presenting a governorship candidate in March 2019 because of a Supreme Court verdict that barred Danladi from running for the post due to age falsification. The suit borders around dishonesty, false declaration and lying on oath as relates to the information contained in the affidavit supporting the personal particulars submitted to INEC by Abubakar Sani Danladi,” he said.
