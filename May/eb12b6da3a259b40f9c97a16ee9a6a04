Nigeria LNG Limited has been recognised by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) as its most Supportive Tax Payer. This recognition was conveyed by the executive chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mr. Muhammad Nami, in which he commended the 20 top-performing taxpayers whose compliances to tax obligations helped the service surpass its N6 trillion tax collection target in 2021.The FIRS was particularly pleased that this feat was achieved, and it was possible to provide the government with the necessary funds to meet the social contracts with the citizens despite the very harsh global economic conditions imposed by the lingering COVID-19 pandemic.The country’s top-performing taxpayers were scheduled to be unveiled, recognised and awarded by president Muhammadu Buhari at an exclusive dinner during the FIRS 2022 National Tax Week, but the event was cancelled due to the unfortunate attack on the Kaduna-Abuja railway on the 28th of March, 2022. Reacting, the Managing director/CEO of Nigeria LNG Limited, Dr. Philip Mshelbila, stated that,  the award was coming at an auspicious time when the company was celebrating its 33rd Incorporation Anniversary and taking stock of its programmes and their impact on the lives of Nigerians and the country. He reiterated NLNG’s commitment to its vision of “helping to build a better Nigeria” and stated further that, the company still has more to give by making gas count for the country and representing Nigeria in the league of top gas producers in the world. Dr. Mshelbila thanked the board, management and staff of NLNG for their continued support. He affirmed the Company’s commitment to fulfilling its tax obligations in line with its vision of being a globally competitive LNG company helping to build a better Nigeria.
