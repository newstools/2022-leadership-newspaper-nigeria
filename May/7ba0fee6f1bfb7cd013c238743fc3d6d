 They stressed that with the incumbent governor, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar, and other stakeholders looking at the younger generation to lead the state, Zakari, 38, according to them, was better placed to be saddled with such leadership responsibility.  Zakari was appointed as the youngest serving cabinet level appointee in President Muhammadu Buhari administration as Special Adviser to the President on Infrastructure in 2019 at the age of 36. He is believed to be one of the rising stars of the APC.  Zakari has overseen the successful implementation of multi-billion-dollar intervention projects in the Nigerian power sector and has been credited with organising the coordination to all aspects of the sector.  Before joining the Buhari-led administration, he rose to the rank of Executive Director, Gas Powered Installed Fleet and Services at General Electric of the United States of America.  In his time as Special Adviser, Zakari has seen to the siting and completion of infrastructural projects worth billions of Naira across the country including in Jigawa State.  This has endeared him to not just the governor of the state, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar but also the people of Jigawa which in turn led to calls from a growing movement across the state for him to run for governor.  He is a pioneer member of the InfraCorp Nigeria Steering Committee (later Board of Directors), with a very close working and personal relationship with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as he has supported the National Economic Council, the National Council on Privatisation and the Niger Delta Power Holding Company all chaired by the Vice President.
