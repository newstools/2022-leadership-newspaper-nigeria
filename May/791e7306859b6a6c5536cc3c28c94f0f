LEADERSHIP reports that the woman, an indigene of Adamawa State, who lived in Orumba South, Anambra State, was on Sunday ambushed by the gunmen unleashing mayhem on innocent people in the South-East region. She was murdered alongside her four children but the motorcyclist conveying her escaped the attack. On the same day, five commercial motorcycle riders were also killed and their bikes burnt at Onocha LGA. Their bodies were deposited in the morgue while the fifth one was burnt to ashes. Reacting to the recent senseless attacks on northerners in South-East, IPOB, via a statement by its spokesperson, Emma Powerful, said the northerners have “suffered” enough, and do not deserve to be targeted. “We reiterate once again that Hausas have suffered much in the hands of Fulani like Biafrans and we will not allow any criminal to touch them again. They are free to do their business anywhere they like in our land
“Those who killed mother and children of Hausa extraction must be ready to face their judgment. They should wait for us, we are coming for them,” IPOB’s statement said.
