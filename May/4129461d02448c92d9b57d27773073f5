The project is aimed at leveraging the large number of potential first-time voters who are young people with about 29 million of them targeted. Every year, an estimated 4.5-5 million Nigerians turn 18, the constitutional age of electoral franchise, which translates to between 18-20 million potential ‘new voters’ from the 2019 general election to the 2023 general election. This increase in the level of first-time voters provides an opportunity for young people to determine the next set of leaders for the country through their participation in active citizenship and the project is aimed at mobilising 29 million young voters. Speaking at a joint press conference, the Executive Director, Yiaga Africa, Mr Samson Itodo, said young Nigerians and women play a critical role in democracy as they can act as catalysts for social change and good governance simply by participating in the electoral process. For his part, UNDP Nigeria Resident Representative, Mohamed Yahya, said youth enthusiasm, resilience, and creativity needed to be harnessed, paired with the right platforms and opportunities for engagement, to help catalyse important changes in Nigeria’s political system. “Although young people between the ages of 18-35 make up 51.1% of registered voters, only 46% of these voters turned out to vote in the 2019 elections. This missed opportunity for young people to shape governance in Nigeria can be reversed with a political mobilization strategy premised on innovation, inclusion, collaboration, consistency, and context-specific interventions,” Yahya said.
