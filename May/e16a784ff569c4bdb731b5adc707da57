No one steals from me. We will ensure that things work in Nigeria,” Anakwenze said. On the security challenges, the presidential aspirant said he will use dialogue to end them. “And if it does not work, we will use force. We will use force and bomb them 24-hours a day. Drones, armed ships, gunship will be used against anyone terrorists that did not accept dialogue,” Anakwenze said stating that it is what the world is doing.
