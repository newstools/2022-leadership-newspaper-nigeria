Madueke who was seeded second for the 44th edition of the competition lost the first set to Atseye 6-3 but bounced back to win the second set 6-7 (10) before Atseye retired in the final set of the final proceedings due to injury. Atseye had come into the game with a lot of confidence after an energy-sapping 4-6, 7-6, 6-4 win over Wilson Igbinovia in the semi-final. Madueke, on the other hand, had quite an easy ride to the final as he dismissed unseeded Friday Gabriel 6-0 6-0 in the other semi-final encounter. Atseye was still expected to dominate the game, in spite of the fatigue element, and he did not disappoint as he quickly went on the front foot, employing an aggressive approach in the first set to take it 6-2. Madueke, however, shook off the early nerves and got his game back on track as he regained control in the second set to take it 7-6 (10) after a long rally which dragged the game late into the night. A physically-exhausted Atseye tried very hard to push himself to the limits and sustained a serious injury in the process. It saw him retiring early in the third set to concede the game to Madueke. “It was not an easy match, but I knew that as long as I kept on fighting, I was going to scale through. “We both had to play two consecutive matches today and even though my opponent’s semi-final game was quite tougher than mine, I knew that I couldn’t rest on my oars,” Madueke said after his victory. In the women’s singles, top seed Marylove Edward defeated second seed Anu Aiyegbesi 6-3, 6-4 to win the title.
