As Nigeria joins other countries in celebration of this year’s Children’s Day, the Coalition of Orphanages and Children Homes in Nigeria (COCHIN) has called on the government, at all levels in the country, and well-meaning Nigerians to support and invest in orphans. The president of COCHIN, Senator Eze Ajoku, who made the call in Abuja yesterday, said the government can support the orphans by setting up more orphanages and children’s homes in every state of the country. Ajoku noted that the number of orphans in Nigeria is growing by the day through the activities of Boko Haram, bandits, kidnappers, HIV/AIDS and other health issues, adding that the government must plan for the growing orphan population. He warned that ignoring this category of Nigerians is to plan for more banditry, kidnapping and other social vices to be committed by children and adults without homes and hopes. Ajoku stated that COCHIN, which is a coalition of registered orphanage owners, is calling on the government to include operators of orphanages as beneficiaries of recovered corrupt proceeds, houses, vehicles and seized contrabands. The COCHIN president said state governments including FCT should provide a monthly subvention, no matter how small, to all certified orphanage homes, even as he requested for utility subsidy for orphanage homes from all Nigeria service providers. He said, “We recommend and propose children’s homes as constituency projects and hereby challenge and appeal to the National Assembly to invest in these children. “We challenge and appeal to corporate institutions to use or adopt children’s homes, as part of their corporate social responsibilities. We also call on religious and faith-based organisations to promote the concept of children homes.”
