Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) resident electoral commissioner for Akwa Ibom State Mr. Mike Igini has assured the nation’s electorate that their votes will count in the forthcoming elections. Speaking at a roundtable discussion on the topic, “Overview and exposition on the Electoral Act 2022” organised by United Action for Change (UAC) in Lagos, Igini assured electorate who have requested or applied for voters card that the commission will made them available before the 2023 general elections because INEC has devised new technology which prevent multiple voting to guide against electoral malpractices. He said with the introduction of Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) it is difficult to have multiple voting and anybody that attempts to have multiple voting or be a surrogate at the polling unit shall be caught. Igini said at the end of voting at every polling unit, the presiding officer will close the poll, just as he urged the electorate at the polling unit to monitor the process, noting that once the entire result is registered, it will be snapped and uploaded into the cloud. He added that once it has been uploaded, the result can be assessed electronically immediately. According to him, since rigging is not possible, some politicians may now want to foment trouble at polling units to disrupt the electoral process, assuring that the electoral umpire shall liaise with security agencies to ensure adequate security.
