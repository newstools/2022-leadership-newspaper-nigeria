Ahead of plans to conduct elections into the 13 Local Government Areas of Ebonyi State in July by the Governor David Umahi-led administration, eminent elders across the five autonomous communities in Afikpo North Local Government Area called on the governor to implement the zoning formula. The elder statesmen, under the aegis of Afikpo North APC Wise Elders Caucus, appealed the warning in a statement in Abakaliki on Tuesday. The letter was addressed to the Governor and signed by its leader, Chief Gabriel Oko Egwu Etu, representing Amasiri Community, Essa Aja Ekoh Eluu, representing Itim Community who is the group’s Spokesperson, Elder Anthony Isu Egwu, representing Ohaisu Community who doubles as the Caucus’ scribe among other representatives from the rest of the five main autonomous communities comprising the council area, the group said it solemnly appeals for the timely intervention of the Governor and indeed, all men of good conscience and morality within his cabinet as plans for the July 2022 Local Government election which has been disclosed by the State’s Electoral body, EBSIEC heats up. They commended the governor for his numerous infrastructural facelifts in Afikpo North especially the dualization of the Timber-Shed/Eke market road, construction of Ogbebi and Mater/Ozizza road, and the ongoing construction of the Amasiri flyover among other numerous projects.  The group also commended the Governor for his wisdom and sincerity in setting up a micro-zoning committee which indeed, visited the council area and afforded the Party’s leaders, elders and stakeholders, including those who may not be members of our party to ventilate their opinions, anger, and frustrations regarding the occupation of political offices in the Local Government council.  “The committee’s findings, which we of course believe is already at the desk of the Governor as an important Memo are very timely, apt, instructive, and strategic especially as politics and political permutations heighten across political parties in our state.  In other words, the findings and recommendations as we say in Afikpo, nay African parlance is like a sharpened two-edged knife; they can be used for useful and purposeful domestic reasons just as they can also be used very destructively, hence, our reason for passionately appealing that Your Excellency finds judicious time out of your busy schedule to see to the implementation of the recommended rotational principles as unearthed and vehemently recommended by the Micro-zoning committee.  The various communities and even sub-communities that make up the entire Afikpo North Local Government Area, numbering five in all and located in 12 electoral wards are patiently waiting for the overall outcome of the promised implementation of the memo to the letter to ensure fairness, equity, and justice in the 2023 general elections in the council”, he maintained, adding;  “As our Afikpo people always say; pari rikote bu ejo oke, interpreted to mean that when one is asked to take all portions of shared meat or property and consume all, he should know he must have shared very badly and denied some or others their right to ownership. We pray and hope this will not be the portion of some communities against the others!”  The group further observed that “it is a fact that many stakeholders have been of the strong and compassionate view, even in the micro-zoning committee’s memo that wisdom demands that hence Amasiri will be completing its occupation of the office of Chairman after two-term in office (appointive and elected)- which they had never occupied before now, it is only morally needful and binding that another large community which has never tasted of the seat should occupy it, hence the preference and decision of the stakeholders to consider another large community with two federal wards that were yet to occupy this important position to be the most favored to produce the successor of the current council boss.”   The group said, “as elders who have taken time to study both the political trajectory of Afikpo North vis-à-vis the new electoral act and the projections of what lies ahead of the Party, therefore, “we wish to advise Your Excellency to rather act expeditiously thus, request sincere stakeholders of our great Party like us, (not the sycophants and bootlickers who are seeking for their daily bread) to recommend for you at least two characters respected across the board and Party line from the said Unwana community (comprising of Ward and B) for you to make your choice of the next council boss, putting into strong considerations, their contributions to community developments and your political successes in the area so far.”  It, therefore, concluded by urging the governor to, as a matter of urgency, “Convene a town hall meeting with elders, women and youth groups of the three affected electoral wards, viz; Nkpoghoro, Itim and Unwana wards who are yet to occupy the State’s House of Assembly position to allow them democratically suggest names of those who are loved and have the requisite capacity and laudable credentials to lead the Council area and our great Party to victory in the 2023 general elections.  Finally, we urge Your Excellency to carry the old APC members and stakeholders along in your decisions concerning the Party in Afikpo North. That way, you will be enriched with the sincere wisdom you need to make the right decisions particularly ahead of the 2023 general elections”, they pleaded.
