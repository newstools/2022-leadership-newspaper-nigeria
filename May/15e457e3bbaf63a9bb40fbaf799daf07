The Bayelsa State-sponsored team overcame five other rivals in the NWFL Super Six Championship, which ended on Sunday in Benin City, the Edo State capital to emerge champions.. Governor Diri described the team’s unbeaten run at the championship as a manifestation that their brilliant performance during the regular season was not a fluke. Diri noted that Bayelsa Queens did not just emerge champions, but also put up one of the best overall performances in the history of the competition as they won all their five matches to amass a total of 15 points. Also, a member of the team, Gift Monday, won the top scorer award after scoring a total of 12 goals during the competition, while Goalkeeper Gabrielle Ange Bawou won the best goalkeeper prize. The Bayelsa Governor, who was full of praise for the team, attributed their brilliant performance to hard work, commitment and focus on the part of the management, the coaches and the players. He also commended the Aisha Falode-led NWFL Board for organising what he described as a hitch-free competition that produced true and worthy champions in Bayelsa Queens.
