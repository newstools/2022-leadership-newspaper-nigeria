Youth leaders under the umbrella of Coalition of Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Youth Groups, have lauded the FCT minister Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello, for upholding the rule of law on the issue of suspension of inauguration of Area Council chairmen. Speaking during a press conference in Abuja, Convener of the group and Vice President of the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Ambassador Akoshile Mukhtar condemned “restiveness that was witnessed across major communities and the city centre of the Federal Capital Territory as a result of the controversies that surround the suspension of the inauguration of the elected Area Council Chairmen by the FCT Minister”. The group said that they had carried out investigations and their findings revealed that “the intent of the agitation was to distract the FCT Administration from governance and heat up the hitherto serene polity of the Federal Capital Territory” and that it was hatched by “selfish politicians” using vulnerable and ignorant youths. While commending the FCT minister, the group acknowledged the fact that the FCTA had sought legal interpretation by a superior court, and there was no basis for agents of destabilization to capitalize on. The group however argued that they were not satisfied with the judgment suspending the inauguration,  they called for calm from all well meaning youth and for them to alert law enforcement on the activities of miscreants seeking to foment trouble in the FCT.
