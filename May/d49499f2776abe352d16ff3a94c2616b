Instead, the minister said he preferred to serve out his term, stating that it is a national assignment which has to do with the development of youths and sports in the country. “The assignment given to me on behalf of the Nigerian people by President Muhammadu Buhari is a national and an important one for the development of our youth and sports. I have in the last three years committed to bringing about far reaching changes in these areas. Noble initiatives and policies are about to be delivered in these sectors. It is my desire to stand down and assist Mr. President complete and to leave a lasting legacy in the areas of youth and sports development for Nigeria,” Dare said. Adding that, “The APC equally has a Presidential election battle ahead to which I will make available my skills and experience like I did in 2014 and 2015 to help our party win the Presidency”.
