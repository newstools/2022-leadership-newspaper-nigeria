The FCT High Court has refused to vacate its order barring the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC )from recognizing the outcome of the purported 3-man Ad hoc delegate election of the PDP held on 30th April 2022 or any other date.  Attempts to vacate the order of the Court failed on Friday as the Court adjourned to the 20th of May 2022. By not vacating the order, the PDP in Imo State will have to conduct the primary elections to select its House of Assembly, House of Representatives, and Senate candidates by the use of only statutory delegates as the delegates’ election of 30th April has been nullified by the Court and also voided by the report from INEC. The primary elections are scheduled to hold on the 18th of May for the House of Assembly, the 20th of May for the House of Representatives, and the 24th of May for the Senatorial primaries. In his reaction to newsmen at the end of the Court sitting, Opposition Coalition Spokesperson, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere hailed the court for its courage. According to him, the court decision is victory for internal party democracy and Imo PDP urging party members to stand strong and only elect credible and popular candidates to lead the party to victory at the general elections.
