Following the threat to shut down air operations from Monday, April 9, 2022 due to hike in aviation fuel, also known as Jet A1, the minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, has said that the ministry was engaging relevant stakeholders to address the situation. The minister, who acknowledged the challenges being faced by the airlines, also said the ministry was not responsible for importing aviation fuel into the country but was already meeting with relevant agencies to address the challenges. Part of the statement signed by the special adviser to the minister on media, Dr James Odaudu, said that: “the attention of the Honourable Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika has been drawn to reports that the nation’s air transportation system will be disrupted as from Monday May 9th, 2022, following threats by airline operators to shut down operations as a result of rising cost of Jet A1, otherwise known as aviation fuel. “As the ministry charged with the management of the industry,  we are greatly concerned about the difficulties being faced by the airline operators in the country in procuring aviation fuel which has resulted in spiraling costs in Air transportation in the immediate past. “We also acknowledge that the airline operators are in the business to make profits, while servicing the very critical sector that is not only the preferred mode of transport for most Nigerians, but also the main international gateway to the nation. “Unfortunately the issue of fuel supply is not within the purview of the ministry and so the much it can do in the present situation is to engage with agencies, institutions and individuals in positions to provide succour to the airlines. This is already being done by the relevant team led by the honourable minister. “While the efforts to assuage the situation are on, we wish to appeal to the airline operators,  even in the difficult situation, to consider the multiplier effect of shutting down operations, on Nigerians and global travellers, in taking their business-informed decisions and actions. “We also assure Nigerians, especially stakeholders in the sector, that the Buhari administration remains stoic in its commitment to the creation and sustenance of an environment that promotes the growth of the aviation industry where major players like the airlines can operate in a profitable and competitive market.”
