The situation has made most of the local governments inept and unable to pay local government workers. Kawu stated this when he interacted with the members of Course 44 of the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies, NIPS Kuru. He said shortfall from the federation account coupled with the inability of most local governments to generate internal revenue has made payment of the salaries of their workers a herculean task. The permanent secretary said the local governments are better equipped to not only pay salaries but also be able to impact positively on the socio-economic lives of the people at the grassroots if they are able to generate revenue on their own. He said Governor Bala Mohammed-led administration in Bauchi State has provided enabling environment for local governments in the state to deliver on their mandates to the people. Kawu said the state government has been promptly paying SUBEB/UBEC counterpart funds to ensure the provision of quality basic education in the state.
