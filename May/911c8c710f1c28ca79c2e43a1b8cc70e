Speaking on the Bank’s performance, the Group managing director/chief executive officer, UBA, Mr Kennedy Uzoka, explained that, despite the myriad of economic challenges on the global front which shaped the first three months of the year, the bank’s business model continued to show resilience. These challenges among others, he noted, include the ongoing crisis between Russia and Ukraine that has resulted in a huge supply shock, pushing up commodity prices; and the hike in the interest rates in most advanced countries aimed at tackling spiraling inflation, sparking capital flow reversal from emerging and frontier markets. Moreover, the CEO of GTCO, Mr. Segun Agbaje, said: “our first quarter results show a decent improvement across key revenue lines as well as other financial metrics, which demonstrates our ability to effectively navigate the evolving business landscape anchored on our strong business fundamentals. “With this performance, we are optimistic about the rest of 2022 as we rapidly consolidate the gains of our new holding company structure to deliver superior stakeholder value.” The chief executive officer, Ecobank Group, Ade Ayeyemi stated that the performance was achieved in a difficult operating environment characterised by the strengthening of the US dollar against local operating currencies, high inflation, high interest rates and tight labour markets across Africa as the Russia-Ukraine conflict continued to take its toll. “Despite these challenges, we continued to support our customers effectively, which paid off as our businesses grew their revenues and profits. These were driven by trade, cash management, FICC and payments, while we also achieved modest loan growth with support from higher interest rates,” he said. Assessing the performance, the managing director, ARM Securities Limited, Mr. Rotimi Olubi said:, “Interest income has been a major driver of earnings across all banks. We have seen a significant increase in banks interest income due to rise in loans from customers and institutions.” He noted that there was increase in banks gross earnings across all banks as a result of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The chief operating officer, InvestData Limited, Mr. Ambrose Omordion said the Q1 2022 is a reflection of economic recovery in Nigeria post COVID-19. According to him, the performance showed the local economy is not doing bad in the Q1, 2022 as projected by the world bank. Banks been the cash flow of the economy have performed beyond expectations. Speaking from a shareholder’s perspective, chairman of the Progressive Shareholders Association of Nigeria, Boniface Okezie, noted that, Nigerian banks have proven to be resilient in growing profits and savings from customers despite domestic and global challenges. “It is a good thing that Nigerian banks are still resilient and are doing very well despite economy challenges. The resilient is what investors are seeing in our banks and are taking position. The Q1, 2022 performance is encouraging and with the growth, shareholders are expecting higher dividend in 2022 full year,” he pointed out.
