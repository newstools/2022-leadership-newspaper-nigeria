The Movement for the Survival of Izon Ethnic Nationality in the Niger Delta (MOSIEND), has described former President Goodluck Jonathan as the only leader that can stabilise Nigeria if re-elected President in 2023.  This is as it said that giving the presidential ticket to Jonathan was the biggest card to continue the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led federal government beyond 2023.  MOSIEND national president, Kennedy Tonjo West, disclosed this in a statement made available to LEADERSHIP in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital on Wednesday.  West commended groups in the Northern part of Nigeria for calling of the former President to contest the 2023 presidential election, saying during his initial tenure, Jonathan was focused and steadily fulfilling his vision and agenda for the country before the interruption and will fastly get things done before any other candidate.  The statement reads in part: “We commend our brothers from the northern part of the country calling for the former President, Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, GCFR, to throw his heart into the ring to contest the 2023 presidential elections, it is a commendable one.  “Dr Goodluck Jonathan stands tall with unmatched track record. In our view the former President is not one who is not power hungry. The whole world knows that Dr Jonathan is not desperate about coming back.Hence, he will be a bit reluctant in accepting this onerous task.  “Of cause Jonathan’s competence to handle Nigeria problems more effectively and efficiently is not in doubt. He is not new in that environment; he was focused and steadily fulfilling his vision and agenda for the country before the interruption and will fastly get things done before any other candidate.”
