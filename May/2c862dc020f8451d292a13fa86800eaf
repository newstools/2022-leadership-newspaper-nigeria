The discrepancies discovered in the delegates’ list brought by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) five-man primary election committee, led by Professor Akase Sorkaa on Wednesday scuttled the accreditation process of the party’s governorship primary in Ogun State. LEADERSHIP observed that sporadic gunshots were fired by security operatives rented the air, thus causing commotion at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), venue of the governorship primary conducted election conducted by the Ogun State chapter of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The security operatives drafted to beef up security and maintain peace at the OOPL venue of the primary election resorted to using life bullets in order to disperse the agitated crowd who became uncontrollable from the two opposing camps. The controversy generated by the conflicting delegates’ list however, created an atmosphere of tension and commotion, but also forced the 11-man supervising officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to excuse themselves momentarily out of the venue for security concerns. Trouble started when the Certified True Copy (CTC) of the national delegates’ list, duly stamped and signed by the INEC headquarters from Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) allegedly said to be a product of the April 30, 2022 state delegates election was presented by the camp of one of the aspirants, Alhaji Jimi Lawal for the purpose of accreditation, but PDP members loyal to Ladi Adebutu also presented another list. LEADERSHIP observed that in the ensuing controversy over which of the delegates’ list was authentic, discrepancies were noticed on the two lists across 11 Local Government Areas (LGAs), while those of the nine LGAs were accurate. INEC however, returned to the venue, after the state chairman of the party, Hon. Sikirulahi Ogundele had secured the guarantee of the security agencies present.
