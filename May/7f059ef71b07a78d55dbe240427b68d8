Policyholders who suffered insured risks were able to claim N11.6 billion from NEM Insurance Plc in 2021, thus, returned them back to the financial position they were before the disaster strucked. The claims paid translated to 26 per cent growth from N8.4 billion paid in 2020. Similarly, its net claims expenses of N5.6billion incurred in 2021 was 9 per cent lower than that of the preceding period, which recorded N6.05billion. The net claims ratio for the period under review was 20 per cent as against 27 per cent in 2020 due to good claims recovery during the period under review. Similarly, the insurance firm witnessed a 26 per cent jump on the gross premium from N22billion it generated in its 2020 financial year to N27.8 billion in its 2021 financial year end. The net premium earned during the period under review was N19.3billion and 23 per cent increase over the preceding period of 2020 which recorded N15.8 billion. While the board recommended a dividend of 22 kobo per ordinary shares to be be paid out of the profit for the year, its group’s  profit after tax(PAT) in the year under review was N4.4billion compared to N5 billion in the previous year, representing a decline of 12.5 per cent. The parent company also recorded a decline of 12 per cent in PAT over the preceding period, hence, the PAT was N5billion in 2020 against N4.4billion in 2021. This, it said, is majorly due to sharp decrease in fair value gain. Speaking at the 52nd annual general meeting(AGM) of the company in Lagos on Thursday, the chairman, Dr. Fidelis Ayebae, said, there were increases of N3billion, N6.9billion and N4.5billion in the group financial assets, total assets and total equity respectively.

While appreciating both the management and members of staff ably led by its group managing director/CEO, Mr. Tope Smart, he applauded the efforts of directors for their efforts, dedication and hard work which are seen in the results being reported in the past years. He equally appreciated all shareholders who have been supportive and loyal to the company, even as he applauded its clients, brokers, agents and reinsurers who have been very consistently supportive.
