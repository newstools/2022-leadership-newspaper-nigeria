Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun, Alli Okunmade ll has lauded the initiatives by National Black Coalition of Federal Aviation Employees (NBCFAE) to create awareness on the diversity of job opportunities available in the aviation industry among the school children. The monarch, who described the initiatives as a very good one deserving of support and encouragement of people of goodwill while speaking with the members of the Coalition led by its national vice president, Mrs. Ejide Fasina Agboola and the past President, Mr. Oludemi Oluleke at his Alarere residence said there is nothing like having good information at the right time. Oba Balogun said the exposure being given to the school children about aviation at their tender age “is of great value because to get to the airport at all is not an everyday affair. “A lot of people don’t get to know anything about aviation until the person is about to travel by air and those who are not opportune to travel by air may through a lifetime not know anything about aviation and what it stands for. “Embedded in the exposure being given to the children is the knowledge of the job opportunities available in the sector. Whatever that can help ameliorate the problem of unemployment in the country is a welcome development and I fully support and embrace your desire to bring your pet project, Aviation Career Education (ACE) to Ibadan metropolis anytime you feel like coming”, Olubadan added. The past president of the association, Mr. Oluleke in his address said the Coalition was established about 50 years ago to promote equal opportunities for Africans/Americans in the aviation industry but came to Nigeria about nine years ago and its objective of introducing the younger generation to the available opportunities in the aviation industry remains the same.
