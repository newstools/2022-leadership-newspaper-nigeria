The round of 16 of Mark D Ball Men Basketball Championship earlier fixed for May 10, 2022 has been rescheduled to hold from May 7 to 10, 2022. The organising committee for the championships announced the slight change in the date of the men’s round of 16 tournament otherwise known as “Sweet 16.” The secretary of the committee, Umar Abdullahi, in a statement Said the Round of 16 jump balls have now been brought forward, to hold between May 7th to 10th, 2022. Abdullahi regretted the adjustment in dates, saying it was necessitated by inability of the stadium management to accommodate the Championship, having already listed other sporting activities to take place at the Indoor Sports Hall, Package B of the MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, during the period of the earlier proposed dates. The statement added that all technical officials and qualified teams have been duly notified, and are all expected to arrive in Abuja on Friday May 6, 2022.
