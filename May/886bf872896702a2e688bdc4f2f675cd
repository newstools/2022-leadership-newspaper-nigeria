Businessman and founder of Silverbird Group, Senator Ben Murray-Bruce, has said that the process of rebuilding Nigeria has started with the emergence of former vice president Atiku Abubakar as the presidential candidate of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).  Atiku, who polled 371 votes to clinch the PDP ticket on Saturday, was also the party’s presidential candidate in 2019 general elections.  Murray-Bruce, who took to his verified Facebook page on Saturday night shortly after Atiku’s victory, said he can vouch for the former vice president’s character and capacity to rebuild Nigeria, adding that PDP delegates made the right choice.  Murray-Bruce wrote: “The former lawmaker wrote I’m so excited! You can’t imagine. H.E Atiku has been my longtime friend and big brother, and I can vouch without any reservations for his character and capacity to rebuild this country, Nigeria.  “Our PDP delegates made the right choice. The process to rebuild Nigeria starts now.”
