The Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation (OGO), a foremost progressive grassroots organisation supporting the ambition of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to succeed his principal, President Muhammadu Buhari, in 2023, has donated N15million to support the purchase of the All Progressives Congress (APC) expression of interest and nomination forms for the Vice President.  The convener of the group, Mr. Foluso Ojo, said that more than 98% of the money came from small donors of less than N5,000.  In his words, “over 5,000 Nigerians have donated this hefty sum to declare their solemn faith in the candidacy of the Vice President, to build a better Nigeria based on fairness, equity, justice, patriotism and hard work. We will not disappoint them.”  The group said the donations, which was crowdsourced in just five days, was a stunning achievement considering that millions of Nigerians at the grassroots face considerable challenges as the country battled two recessions and various other headwinds.  “Regardless, this donation is a show of faith of the Nigerian people in the Osinbajo project; that they won’t give up in the face of these challenges.  “The Osinbajo Grassroots Organization, with over 1.5 million members in over 8,900 Wards that make up the federation has promised to mobilise 20 million votes for the Vice President at the general election if the the All Progressives Congress ( APC) gives him the ticket,” Ojo stated.
