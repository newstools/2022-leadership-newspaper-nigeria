Capital market analysts have predicted a mixed performance for equities this week, as the market enters June, the last month of 2022 first half. They noted that market players will continue to digest the macro-economic data, among other developments to support an uptrend in the new month amid the rebound in oil prices sentiments in the coming week. Meanwhile, with the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decision to increase the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to 13.0 per cent at its recently concluded meeting, the first rate hike since July 2016, analysts believe this was triggered by a knee-jerk reaction from investors, given that rising fixed income (FI) yields typically make equities less attractive. According to them, 2022 being a pre-election year further suggests that investors would minimise exposure to risk assets. Nonetheless, we do not envisage a prolonged bearish run in the market, given the strong corporate earnings delivered by companies in the Q1, 2022 earnings season. As such, we think a short-term market correction will present opportunities for investors to make re-entry into stocks with sound fundamentals and attractive dividend yields. Analysts Optimism In the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited expect to see a mixed reaction to the daily change of the local bourse, saying, “this we believe will be as a result of no upcoming company’s financial release for the new week. “However, investors are advised to trade on companies’ stocks with good fundamentals and positive outlook so as to avoid falling into the bear trap.” Cordros Capital Limited said: “With the recent decision of the MPC to hike the MPR by 150bps, we expect negative sentiments to dominate market performance in the short term. Nonetheless, we think a short-term market correction will present opportunities for investors to make re-entry in stocks with sound fundamentals and attractive dividend yields. Overall, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the fragility of the macroeconomic environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Afrinvest Limited pointed out that,  “this week, we anticipate mild gains in the market supported by bargain hunting.
