Eight persons have been arrested by the Cross River State Police Command over the shooting and killing of a policeman, Martins Mbang, while on duty at the PDP House of Representatives primary elections in Obudu LGA of Cross River State, yesterday. The suspects were arrested in connection with the killing of the police officer and injuring two other policemen while they were on duty in Obudu LGA of Cross River State. The police officer was shot during the party primaries conducted by the PDP hierarchy to nominate the party’s flagbearer in the forthcoming 2023 general election for the Obudu/Obanliku/Bekwara federal constituency. The rescheduled primaries were slated to take place at the Handmaid’s International Nursery and Primary School along hospital road, Obudu LGA of Cross River State. A source in Obudu who spoke on condition of anonymity told LEADERSHIP that the policeman was shot by a political thug whom he does not know the aspirant  he works for. He revealed that the dead policeman was shot at the main entrance of the venue, while two other police officers were also hit by the bullet. Findings however revealed that the thug is a staunch supporter of one of the aspirants who probably may not have been comfortable with the way things were going. The development led to mass protest resulting to armed policemen coming out to chase everyone away from venue of the contest. Confirming the incident, police public relations officer (PPRO) Irene Ugbo stated that eight persons have been arrested in connection with death of the police officer.
