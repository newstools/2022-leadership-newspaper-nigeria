The operatives of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Kwara State, have arrested a 65-year-old security guard, Oluwole Akinola, over alleged abduction of two minors. Akinola was also alleged to have sexually assaulted the minors when they were in his custody. The spokesman of the NSCDC in the State, Babawale Afolabi, who confirmed the arrest of the security guard, explained further that the the Gender-based Violence Unit of the agency “is currently interogating the suspect while the two victims are also helping in the investigation. “It will be recalled that one of the victims’ fathers, Borokini Oluwaseun, of Aduralere street, Ilorin had come to the NSCDC office to complain that his 12-year-old daughter, Semilore, who had been declared missing for some days was found in the custody of one Akinola Oluwole, 65, who lives in Shao Garage area of the metropolis. “The timely arrival of the NSCDC operatives saved the suspect from mob action as the people of the neighbourhood insisted that this would not be first time Oluwole would be accused of rape and sexual molestation of minors. “In his preliminary statement, the suspect, who claimed to have lost his wife 15 years ago, denied to have sexually assaulted the minors, adding that the two girls actually approached him to shelter them but he did not sleep with them but harboured them for days,” Babawale added. He said the State Commandant of NSCDC, Makinde Iskil Ayinla, has ordered that the two minors should undergo further medical examinations while the case be transfered to the Gender-based Violence Unit of the Corps for proper investigation and possible prosecution of the suspect.
