The 23-year-old mentioned that he had spoken to the English club on two separate occasions, the first being in 2017 when he was still at Monaco. This is because Liverpool FC is the favourite club of his Mum, Fayza Lamari. Speaking to The Telegraph, he said: “It’s a good club and we met them five years ago. When I was in Monaco I met them. It’s a big club. I talked to Liverpool because it’s the favourite club of my mum, my mum loves Liverpool. I don’t know why, you will have to ask her.” Mbappe’s comments come after Liverpool boss Klopp was asked about the Paris Saint-Germain star earlier this month. Jurgen Klopp said earlier this month that Liverpool were interested in him (Mbappe) and the player confirmed this, that there had been some contact. When asked about a month ago, if there was interest in the World Cup winner, the Liverpool manager said: ‘Of course we are interested in Kylian Mbappe, we are not blind.
‘We like him and if you don’t like him then you have to question yourself. But, no, we are not, we cannot be part of these battles.
‘There must be other clubs involved and that is fine. He is a great player.’ It is clear that Liverpool have been linked with the forward in the past but all signs seemed to point at the player joining Real Madrid.
Recall, that the French man had been widely tipped to join Real Madrid this summer but surprised the Spanish champions by signing a contract extension until 2025 with PSG last week. Liverpool and Real Madrid will meet in Paris on May 28 in the Champions League final and Mbappe has said he would be in attendance and would be supporting Real Madrid.
