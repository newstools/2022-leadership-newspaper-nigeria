A competent source at the ABUTH told journalists in Zaria that Moriki died at the hospital yesterday. The source said the hospital had already liaised with the state epidemiology unit, which has the responsibility of taking the samples to Abuja for confirmation and is awaiting the result. The source disclosed that Moriki was admitted at the Tudun Wada branch of ABUTH last Thursday and later transferred to ABUTH Shika where he died yesterday. It was gathered that Moriki was a consultant at Kauran Wali Clinic in Zaria, where he was suspected to have come in contact with a woman suspected to be infected with Lassa fever in the course of discharging his medical responsibility. The contact with the woman also led to the death of Abubakar who is also a staff of the clinic, who died on Saturday March 19th. Moriki was buried according to Islamic rites at Dambo Cemetery, Jos Road Zaria following infectious diseases prevention protocols. Corroborating the story, Dr. Hamza Ikara, director of Disease Control, Kaduna State Primary Healthcare Development Agency, said a medical team from the state government would liaise with the facilities over the incident.
