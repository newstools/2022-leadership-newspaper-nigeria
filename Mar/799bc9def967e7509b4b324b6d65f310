North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has said he expects the regional bloc to move to strengthen its eastern flank by deploying four new battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. He told journalists ahead of the United States (US)-led alliance’s emergency meeting today that China should condemn Russia’s invasion and “to engage in diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful way to end the war as soon as possible.” Stoltenberg warned Moscow it cannot “win a nuclear war” and urged the Kremlin to stop its “dangerous irresponsible nuclear rhetoric.” He accused Belarus of being “complicit” in Russia’s invasion by allowing its territory to be used for massing troops. He also said Minsk continues to enable the offensive by allowing Moscow to use its military airfields in comments that come a day after reports that Belarus was likely to join Russia’s war in Ukraine. Stoltenberg reiterated that NATO would not send troops into Ukraine but said the crisis had shown the alliance must reset its deterrence and defence posture.  Meanwhile, Russia plans to switch its gas sales to “unfriendly” countries to roubles. President Vladimir Putin said “Russia will continue, of course, to supply natural gas in accordance with volumes and prices … fixed in previously concluded contracts,” Putin said at a televised meeting with top government ministers. “The changes will only affect the currency of payment, which will be changed to Russian rubles,” he added. Putin said the government and central bank had one week to come up with a solution on how to move these operations to the Russian currency and that gas giant Gazprom would be ordered to make the corresponding changes to gas contracts. Russia’s list of “unfriendly” countries, which corresponds to those that imposed sanctions, includes the US, European Union member states, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada and Ukraine, among others.
