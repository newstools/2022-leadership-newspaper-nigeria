Cautious trading is expected to continue on the Nigerian stock market this week. OLUSHOLA BELLO writes. Capital market analysts are expecting cautious trading activities to continue on the Nigerian stock market pending any significant change in the economic conditions. Also, market players will continue to keenly observe the nation’s economic developments and what is happening in the fixed income market with yields and rates becoming mixed and flattish. Already, all eyes are on the plans by Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), at the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting to deliver on the promised intervention in the distribution of premium motor spirit and diesel. The aim is to ease the pains of the scarcity among manufacturers, SMEs and households across the country, in the face of the epileptic power supply. Analysts Optimism In the new week, Cowry Assets Management Limited expects the NGX All-share index to close in green territory amid further releases of year-end corporate financial results and dividend declarations. However, it expects some share prices to be marked down this week, a move that could dent the bullish sentiment in the equities market. Afrinvest Limited stated that, “In the last trading week of first quarter (Q1), we expect pessimism to persist in the absence of positive catalysts.” Analysts at Cordros Securities Limited noted that “In the week ahead, we expect the market to trade sideways as the activities of bargain hunters in dividend-paying stocks fizzle out due to the winding down of the 2021 full year earnings season. “In addition, risk-averse investors will likely sustain profit-taking activities in anticipation of an uptick in fixed income (FI) yields. Notwithstanding, we reiterate the need for positioning in only fundamentally sound stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.”  Last Week’s Trading Activities The local stock market sustained its profit taking activity as investors sold their shares ahead of corporate financial releases. Particularly, investors took profit on shares of RT Briscoe, UACN Property Development Company (UPDC) and Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO), even as the Tier-one’s share price was marked-down for dividend payment. Given the bearish sentiment, NGX All-Share Index declined 0.67 per cent week-on-week (W-o-W) to close at 46,964.23. Similarly, market capitalisation decreased by N172 billion to close at N25.311 trillion. In the same vein, all sector gauges closed in negative territory amid profit taking activity. The NGX Banking index, NGX Insurance index, NGX Consumer Goods index, NGX Oil & Gas index and the NGX Industrial Goods index decreased by 0.66 per cent, 1.40 per cent, 1.10 per cent, 0.02 per cent and 0.02 per cent respectively to close at 440.79 points, 185.53 points, 564.50 points, 442.02 points and 2,116.52 points respectively. The market breadth for the week was negative as 24 equities appreciated in price, 44 equities depreciated in price, while 88 equities remained unchanged.
