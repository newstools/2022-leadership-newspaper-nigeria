A mother, Mrs Chigozie Onuobu and her three children were on Tuesday night burnt to death following a mysterious fire that gutted their thatched house. The incident happened at Aguabata Echara in Ikwo local government area of Ebonyi state. A family member, Mr. Samuel Okoro who visited the scene alleged that the fire incident was human made as there was no trace of bush burning around the building. “I don’t think it was not deliberate. There was no trace of bush burning around the building. Moreover, they have a separate kitchen where they cook”. “The woman is my cousin’s sister. Actually, the man married two wives but the first wife is not living with them in the same compound”. “I was told that when some people called the husband of the deceased on the development, he nearly fainted”. “However, when we asked him, the neighbor said they didn’t know his whereabouts. Maybe they felt we wanted to beat the man or express our anger”. “But we will go back especially when the burnt dead bodies are still there,” Okoro said. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO)  in the state, DSP Loveth Odah could not confirm the incident but said she was in a meeting and promised to get details of the incident.
