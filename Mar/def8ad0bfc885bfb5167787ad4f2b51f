National chairmanship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, has assured that the party under his leadership will consolidate on the gains made by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration. The Senator, representing Niger East senatorial zone in the 9th Senate, added that his vision was to restore Nigeria’s glorious days and take her back to the prosperous years of the past. A statement signed by his media adviser, Nasir Mohammed, said Senator Musa made the declaration after purchasing his nomination form as a contestant for the coveted APC national chairmanship seat, which will be congested at the party’s national convention on March 26. The statement added that Musa noted that while Nigeria has witnessed rapid infrastructural development in the railway, roads and aviation sectors, the ruling party under his watch will not only continue the great strides of President Buhari but will fine-tune some other policies and execute them diligently to achieve greater results for the citizenry. The national chairmanship aspirant also stressed the need to commend President Buhari for rescueing the party from the brink of collapse with his intervention on the debacle witnessed on the account of the APC Caretaker Committee chairman’s absence. Musa, who is seen as a frontrunner in the race because of his forthrightness and life devoid of blemish, praised President Buhari for allowing a level playing field for all the aspirants to contest. The zoning of the national chairmanship position of the APC to the North-Central makes Senator Musa’s chances brighter as the the national convention draws near.
