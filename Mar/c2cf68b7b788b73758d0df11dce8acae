Former Super Falcons coach, Godwin Izilein, has the leadership of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) against interfering in Coach Austin Eguavoen’s work, saying the coach should be given free hands to execute his plans on the Nigeria/Ghana double-header. Izilein made the call while speaking to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Benin City on Tuesday. He commended the NFF for giving Eguavoen the opportunity to serve the country and welcome constructive criticisms that will keep the coach on his toes and deliver on the task given to him to Nigerians. “If given the opportunity to select his team and backed with prayers from Nigerians and in the absence of distraction, Eguavoen will deliver on this mandate,” he stated. On the Nigeria/Ghana double-header, Izilein, who praised the players selection, said that the Eagles would triumph over their Ghanaian opponent. According to him, from the analysis, the players were picked based on their current forms in their respective club sides. “I am particularly glad that Eguavoen picked two players for each position in case of any injury, this made it seamless in changing the injured Ndidi. “Ghana is a tough side, but we are beating them. They are presently confused because they know the quality of players we have in Super Eagles.” On Odion Ighalo’s invitation, Izilein said, “Ighalo’s experience is needed to direct affairs of the coaches inside the pitch and no one can deny the fact that he is a quality striker.” NAN reports that the double-header game is scheduled for March 25 and March 29 in Kumasi and Abuja respectively. The winner of the game qualifies as one of Africa’s representatives in the 2022 FIFA World Cup to be hosted by Qatar.(NAN
