Maize Association of Nigeria (MAAN) yesterday said the price of maize in the Nigerian market is expected to fall as it prepares to unveil Kaduna maize pyramid in coming weeks. MAAN national president, Dr Bello Abubakar who gave pre-launch briefing in Abuja yesterday told newsmen that despite insecurity and climate change challenges, maize farmers have been able to produce  20 million metric tonnes as at the end of 2021. Maize and other 22 agricultural commodities are part of the federal government Anchor Borrowers Programme designed to accelerate food security, economic growth and job creation. The 21 maize pyramids which will be unveiled on 22 March, 2022, will also mark the 30th Anniversary celebration of the association and would follow with a book launch to guide good agronomic practices to enhance more production. Dr Abubakar said, “The price of maize will come down by the time we release the maize to the off takers, we have achieved a lot and more is coming, so after the celebration of the 30th Anniversary, whatever we have achieved, we are going to double it and so Nigerians will benefit, we have our off takers but we are going to have a stakeholders meeting between MAAN, CBN and Unity Bank to agree on the price before the launch”. Explaining the rationale behind the pyramids, Dr Abubakar said the essence was a demonstration of  MAAN’s capacity to produce sufficient maize for Nigeria’s market and to show that the Anchor Borrowers loans can be repaid.
