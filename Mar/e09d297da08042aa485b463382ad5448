The approval followed the consideration of the conference committee report on the Bill after it was laid by the Deputy Senate Leader, Senator Robert Ajayi Boroffice (APC, Ondo North). Boroffice, in his presentation, said the conference committee met and deliberated on the two versions of the Bill as passed by both chambers of the National Assembly. “The Committee observed that the version passed by the House of Representatives included further amendments made on the version passed by the Senate which exhaustively incorporates issues that are acceptable to majority of stakeholders in the Nigerian Postal industry. “As part of the process of further engagement with the stakeholders, new facts and positions emerged and these have been fully articulated and incorporated in the version of the House of Representatives,” he explained. He further explained that after extensive deliberations, the Conference Committee resolved and adopted the Senate Version in Clauses 3(3): 28(5): 35(1); and 36(1) while Clauses 8(1); 9(n); 10(1); 33(t); 68(2)(b); 72(1) and 75 of the House of Representatives’ version of the Bill were adopted. The Senate, thereafter, approved the conference committee report on the NIPOST Bill, 2022, thereby passing the piece of legislation into law.
