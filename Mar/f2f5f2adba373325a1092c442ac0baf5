Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi yesterday said that it would grant unconditional amnesty to anyone who volunteers to lay down arms in the Effuim/Ezza Effuim communal war in Ohaukwu local government area of the State. There had been violent attacks and counter-attacks between people of Effuim and Ezza Effuim communities, resulting in loss of lives and destruction of properties worth millions of naira. In a statement yesterday, the state government said the decision to grant amnesty to the warring factions became necessary after an extensive peace talk with respect to finding a lasting solution to the crisis. The statement noted that both parties have agreed to a ceasefire. The deputy governor, Barr Kelechi Igwe and Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Francis Nwifuru on behalf of the governor announced the intention to grant amnesty to the people of Effium and Ezza Effium in the unfortunate crisis that bedeviled them. The state mandated all both factions in the community to toe part of peace and embrace the amnesty that took effect from yesterday. It stated that anyone who volunteers to drop his or her arms will receive the amnesty unconditionally. “This amnesty further extends to those who are presently in correctional facility and police custody in connection with the crisis.” The statement also requested all Ezza Effium indigenes to attend the amnesty ceremony on Tuesday, 8th March 2022 at Central School, Effium.
