In order to avoid legitimacy crisis, the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has barred political appointees from voting at the national convention of the party slated for Saturday, March 26, 2022. CECPC, in a statement on Thursday, expressly declared that “all political appointees who were elected as delegates to the National Convention slated for 26/3/2022 SHALL NOT VOTE in view of the controversy surrounding Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.” The committee, however, stated that political appointees can still attend the convention as observers. LEADERSHIP reports that Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 is currently a subject of disagreement between the Executive arm of government and the National Assembly. A Federal High Court sitting Umuahia, Abia State, had last week ordered the deletion of the said Section of the electoral law, saying it offends some Sections of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). However, the National Assembly, on Wednesday, announced that it will appeal the judgment of the Abia Court at the appellate Court.
