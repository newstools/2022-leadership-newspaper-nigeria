The minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami has launched the third National Identification Number (NIN) diaspora Enrolment centre in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The newly opened centre managed by National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) Licensed Diaspora Enrollment partner, Knowledge Square and Plectrum Limited brings the total number of centres opened in 38 countries to 152. Professor Pantami accompanied at the event by NIMC director general/CEO, Engr. Aliyu Aziz, reiterated the federal government’s commitment to ensure that all Nigerians have the foundational identity, most especially Nigerians in the diaspora. Aziz emphasised the need for all Nigerians living and working in the UAE to enroll and be issued the NIN. Meanwhile, Professor Pantami used the occasion to showcase and educate Nigerians in the diaspora on the recently launched FG’s NIN Tokenisation policy which was unveiled on 16th September 2021 by President Muhammadu Buhari, as part of his administration’s policy of ensuring the protection of data of all NIN holders, especially for verification to access all government services. Recall that the federal government had earlier announced the 31st March, 2022 as the deadline for the adaptation of the Tokenization NIN Verification policy by both the public and private sector. NIMC shall cut-over all verification transactions to the NIN Tokenization service with effect from 31st March, 2022.
