The Flour Mills Women Network strategy has established a substantial and impactful outreach programme to inspire and empower young girls and women to create and hinge critical support for them through the United Nations SDG 4&5 goals. The company, in a statement to LEADERSHIP, hinted that despite the growing awareness about gender diversity and inclusion, women’s rights are still not respected or protected in many parts of the world. The company mentioned that women have continued to be disproportionately affected by poverty, discrimination, and exploitation, as well as other monumental barriers that prevent them from reaching their full potential. While addressing the issue with the theme of this year’s International Women’s Day, ‘break the bias,’ it explained that, it would seek to highlight the benefits of a world free of bias, stereotypes, and discrimination against girls and women. This is even as the FMN Women’s Network visited Apapa Senior High School as part of an outreach programme designed specifically for senior class girls to mark the international women’s day. In addition, the education outreach programme was essentially hinged on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals – SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 5 (Gender Equality) with the critical focus of empowering and inspiring young girls towards a more deliberate and impactful future. This, it emphasized, in keeping with the tenets of this year’s theme, Break the Bias – Stand out, with the outreach program that sought to provide a platform where girls could discover and develop their true potentials through curated sessions on specific career mentorship and general questions and answer sessions intended to inspire the girls. Meanwhile, Over 100 students attended the outreach programme, aimed to motivate and inspire girls to become better people for themselves, their communities, provided a safe space where young girls could discuss their ambitions openly and receive the necessary guidance and encouragement. Also, in addition to learning first-hand from professionals on building strategies to help them stand out from the crowd, the girls and their teachers also received gifts at the end of the session.
