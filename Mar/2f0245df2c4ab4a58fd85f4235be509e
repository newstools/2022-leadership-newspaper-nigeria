Supporters of the former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, on Wednesday, stormed the International Conference Centre (ICC) Abuja for his official declaration to contest for the presidency in 2023. Among the dignitaries at the declaration event were former Vice President Namadi Sambo; Adamawa State governor, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri; former Niger State governor, Babangida Aliyu, and Chief Tom Ikimi, among others. Other associates present at the ceremony included Senator Dino Melaye, Ambassador Roland Omowa and Josephine Anenih. In his address Governor Fintiri told the crowd that Atiku Abubakar represents a special treasure to Nigeria, adding that “He is probably the most experienced person in the presidential race at the moment not only in our party, the PDP but in the country.” He said Atiku’s lack of victory over the years, might have been for a purpose like this moment, “like 2023 when Nigeria will be led by a person of his capacity, acumen and pedigree to lead the country after colossal damage meted on it by the fallen APC.” Fintiri said, “Atiku Abubakar is well prepared to lead Nigeria at his most demanding moment. He built a world-class university in the heart of the most educationally disadvantaged region in Nigeria. He has created wealth and provided jobs as a politician. His democratic credential is unequalled. He is the President that will unite and secure the country, salvage the economy and create jobs for our citizens.”
