Justice Nzeukwu of an Imo State High Court has ruled that a former state chairman of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Chief Dan Nwafor, was rightfully removed and should stop laying claims to the office. Justice Nzeukwu in suit number HOW/745/2020 ruled that Nwafor and other members of the state working committee were dissolved and ordered them not to parade themselves as executives of the party. The court ruled; “Dan Nwafor and others, having been duly and lawfully dissolved by the National Working Committee of the party are hereby perpetually restrained from parading or holding out themselves or in any manner functioning as members of the executive committee of the APC in Imo State.” Nwafor had under former governor Rochas Okorocha emerged as the state APC chairman but were dissolved by the former national chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, and it has been an issue of contention since then. The party has since held a congress that produced Dr Macdonald Ebere as the current state chairman.
