Residents of Enugu State have raised the alarm over the sudden increment in water rates in the state. Our correspondent who went round Enugu discovered that the price to fill a five hundred liters capacity water storage tank is now over N5000 against the N3000 initial price for the tank. They blame the increment on the lingering fuel crisis. It was overserved that water vendors are now collecting between N50 and N100  to fill a four liter of jerrycan against 10 naira that was collected by water vendor before the crisis. Some of the water vendors, who spoke to our correspondent attributed the increment to the fuel crisis. “We use fuel to pump water for people to buy. You have seen what is happening, apart from the high cost of fuel, we find it difficult to even see the fuel to buy and by the time you remove the price of fuel, you can imagine what will be remaining” Mr. Ukonu Anuforo stated, a water vendor stated. A resident of Enugu, Mr Fabian Cajetan said before the fuel crisis, they were finding it difficult to get water, adding that the situation has worsened with the fuel crisis. “We are not finding it easy at all, the vendors are finding it difficult to sell water because of the fuel crisis. When you ask them, they will tell you that the Pump Price of fuel and fuel crisis are the cause of the problem” he stated. Meanwhile, our investigations revealed that the prices of almost all the commodities in the market have increased because of the fuel crisis.
