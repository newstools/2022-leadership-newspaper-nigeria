Eni, the parent company of Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC), has said it will lift force majeure on expected oil output at its Brass terminal in Yenagoa, Bayelsa state. Eni had cut oil and gas exports from its Brass export terminal. According to the company, the new development follows the completion of repairs on the Ogoda/Brass 24 oil pipeline at Okparatubo, which was hit by a blast on March 5. The Italian energy firm said in a statement on yesterday that the blast was caused by third-party interference. Force majeure is a clause that allows a92 step that allows companies not to meet contractual obligations for reasons that are out of their control. Shipments of the two grades had been planned at a rate of 170,000 barrels a day next month but have been in a state of decline over the past few years, according to loading programmes seen by Bloomberg. Flows back in 2020 were planned at about 320,000 barrels a day. A force majeure doesn’t necessarily mean the entirety of supply will be lost for a given period of time. Stored cargoes could still be shipped and repairs would allow shipments to resume. The market is closely watching what will happen to Russian oil supply in the wake of the country’s invasion of Ukraine. Some oil companies have stopped buying new cargoes from Moscow and some governments have announced that they are imposing bans on petroleum imports from Russia. Shell has said it will try to go elsewhere for barrels. The lost shipments could be significant for Nigeria. country was scheduled to export almost 1.5 million barrels a day this month, loading plans show. It wasn’t clear when Eni’s force majeure began. The company said that Nigeria LNG is also affected by its measure.
