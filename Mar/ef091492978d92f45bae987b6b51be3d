Trillbjm lives in a world of his own and is ahead of the pack. He is officially the  youngest and most innovative Chief Technology Officer (CTO) in Africa, a position he occupies in respectable crypto companies, including Patricia in Nigeria. Trillbjm facilitated wide adoption of cryptocurrency in West Africa, which has been spreading like wildfire, by infusing financial technologies services and value added services into the blockchain. After a recent visit to the Museum Of The Future in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the young brain declared that the web was still being under-exploited. “The web as I envisaged, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past. Everybody has to be able to participate in a future that they want to live for. That’s what technology can do,” Trillbjm wrote. Talking about the future, what will become of the Fintech and innovative technology, Trillbjm added, “I first identify a problem I may have at a particular time, I then think of a viable solution. If I can solve that problem, I try to amplify it enough to reach other people who like myself require the solution. This is my secret tool.”
