A member of the House of Representatives, Hon Dumnamene Robinson Dekor has applauded Rivers State governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike’s declaration to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Dekor, who represents Khana/Gokana federal constituency in the House of Representatives, in a statement made available to newsmen in Port Harcourt yesterday, described Wike’s declaration as most timely, to save Nigeria from further assaults from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He stated that the depth of economic downturn in Nigeria occasioned by the lack of vision and the ineptitude of the APC leadership has made it necessary to have a president with the capacity of the Rivers State governor to stop the country from total collapse. The lawmaker further stated that the antecedents of Wike qualify him as the best man for the job especially in this critical time of the nation’s chequered political history. Dekor said, Governor Wike’s developmental strides in Rivers State since he took oath of office in 2015, have launched the state into the league of best democratically led and developed in the country and could be replicated in all parts of Nigeria if given the opportunity to occupy the number one seat in the country. “Without mincing words and if we can be true to ourselves, there is every need to change the country’s present narratives. The Nigerian citizens are dying per minute per hour of hunger, hardship, frustrations and many more are lost to banditry, kidnappers, terrorist attacks, armed robbery etc due to the collapse of the nation’s security architecture. “To turn the economy around and get Nigeria walking again, a man with the capacity and the political will, a detribalized and selfless leader is the person we need. In all of these, I am most convinced that the person the cap fits is  Chief Barr Nyesom Wike,” he said.
