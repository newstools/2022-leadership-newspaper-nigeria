The Confederation of African Football (CAF) doping officer for Tuesday’s second leg of the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup play-off match between Nigeria and Ghana, Dr Joseph Kabungo, has died after violence erupted at the end of the match at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja. Kabungo, a Zambian medical practitioner, was reported to have lost consciousness after he was beaten and stepped on as fans try to make their way out of the stadium due to stampede. In a post on Twitter by British-Nigerian journalist, Osasu Obayiuwana, his death was confirmed after he was rushed to the hospital. Neither officials of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) nor CAF has confirmed the official’s death. It was learnt that Kabungo’s family, the Zambia FA and the Government of Zambia had been informed.
