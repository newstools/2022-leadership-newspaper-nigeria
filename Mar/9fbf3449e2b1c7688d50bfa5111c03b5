He’s humble, focused and intelligent. People ask if he has the money to pursue this ambition. That is why we are here to buy this form for him. He’s not aware but we as professional and apolitical, we want him to lead,” he said. Speaking on PDP’s zoning arrangement, he noted that PDP should present her best candidate and look at zoning after winning elections. “As regards zoning, we believe Tambuwal is a native of Nigeria and this is someone who is at home in all parts of the nation. Just look at us, we have Yoruba, Igbo, Ibibio, and we are saying, PDP, put your best foot forward. You can see there is no money bags here, but the little we have, we will use it for him. He noted that PDP has the best chance of winning the 2023 presidential election if it presents governor Tambuwal as the party’s flagbearer. “PDP, you have a good chance to win this election. This election will be decided by simple Nigerians and we are part of that simple Nigerians.”
