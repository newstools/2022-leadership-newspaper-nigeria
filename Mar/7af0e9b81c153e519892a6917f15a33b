On the results, Cordros Securities Limited said: “we like that BUA Cement optimised its price/volume mix to keep margins stable despite energy cost pressures caused by the local currency devaluation amid high inflationary pressures. “We expect private sector demand for cement to moderate this year as activities in the real estate sector normalise to pre-pandemic levels. “In addition, we are concerned about the ability of the company to transfer the burden of elevated energy prices to consumers in a bid to preserve margins, given that cement producers have raised prices significantly over the past two years. “Nevertheless, we believe economies of scale associated with the new and energy-efficient Kalambiana line II (3MMT) will provide some support for margins.” Recently, the managing director of BUA Cement, Mr. Yusuf Binji, reassured that the organisation was committed to remaining a value-driven, oriented company that prioritises excellence and product quality. He also added that the company was well-poised to sustain current profitability despite the very competitive landscape. “Our value proposition, in terms of product and service support offerings has positioned BUA Cement as a market leader. “In addition, we continue to prioritise innovation and continuous improvement, thereby ensuring the continued fit of our products to ever-changing customer demands and needs. “We are also investing in the latest plant designs which not only drive efficiency but translate into value addition to our customer through the cost savings derived,” Binji said.
