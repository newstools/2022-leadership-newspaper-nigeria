Taking a cursory look at the outcomes of recent by-elections in some states, the governor listed intensive voters’ education, campaign against rigging, mobilisation of rural voters, guarding votes cast and exploiting the schisms threatening the cohesion of the APC, as issues that need to be addressed to ensure the victory of PDP in 2023. Tambuwal highlighted these observations when the contact and consultation committee of the presidential support group of former Senate President Bukola Saraki paid him a courtesy call. “I advised the PDP to study and analyze the aforementioned by-elections and take note of the problems in APC and take lessons from these elections going forward. “It is very important that we do a clear and dispassionate analysis of voting patterns as we proceed and approach 2023. If we do so, we will be guided as a party when it comes to putting forward our candidates. “We should not be carried away by winning that important and coveted Jos North federal constituency election, but we should be what we are, a party of people who are skilled in politics, endowed with leaders who are very knowledgeable and skillful in the electoral processes and election management,” he stated. Tambuwal, who is also the chairman of the PDP-Governors Forum appealed to all stakeholders in the party to work together, since the objective is the same and ensure that they rescued Nigeria.
