Given the bearish trading activities last week, capital market analysts have predicted that bulls are expected to return to the Nigerian stock market following the spate of corporate actions and Oil & Gas acquisitions. Analysts Optimism Analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited expects a marginal bullish run in the equities market on the back of year-end corporate releases this month, saying “specifically, we feel that the NGX Oil & Gas index may witness sustained rise amid the conflict in Eastern Europe.” Cordros Securities Limited said: “we expect investors to take advantage of the significant moderation in the share prices to make a re-entry in dividend-paying stocks in the week ahead. However, we envisage a zig-zag pattern as intermittent profit-taking activities will likely persist due to medium-term expectations on the direction of yields in the FI market. “Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” GTI Securities Limited added that, “bulls are expected to return to the market given the spate of corporate actions and oil and gas acquisitions, we anticipate improved market activity to encourage a bullish response this week.” However, Afrinvest Limited said: “in the absence of positive catalysts to lift performance in the market, we expect the weak performance to persist in this week.” Last Week’s Trading Activities In the just concluded week, the local bourse witnessed bearish activity as investors turned their paper profit to cash in order to avoid a dividend trap. Particularly, intense profit-taking activities witnessed in International Breweries, Lafarge Africa, NASCON Allied Industries (NASCON), Dangote Sugar Refinery, United Bank for Africa (UBA), and Guinness Nigeria drove the weekly loss.
