Residents of the popular Utako village in Abuja yesterday had a clash with scavengers when they tried to protect their property from being stolen by scavengers who were bent on carting away whatever they could lay their hands on during the demolition of houses in the village. The scavengers who defied the presence of security operatives were seen snatching different items from residents of the village, who were overwhelmed by the trauma of seeing the FCTA demolition bulldozers ramming into hundreds of structures. The director, department of development control, Muktar Galadima, said the demolition exercise was a special operation to remove all illegal structures and pave way for the original allottees to regain their land. He added that quit notices had been given to the squatters long ago to enable them safely relocate. The senior special assistant on monitoring, inspection and enforcement to FCT minister, Ikharo Attah, said the operation was also targeted at addressing perennial traffic and criminal activities in the area. Attah who also doused the tension generated over speculation that the homes of the indigenous people within the village would be demolished, assured that only illegal structures on the land allocated to the FCT Police Command were marked for demolition. He added that the demolition exercise would help to restore the environmental sanitation and aesthetic of the Utako district. “We are only removing the illegal shanties to reclaim the land for the original allottees.  We are not demolishing the houses of indigenous people. The cleanup will also help to address the disturbing traffic gridlock and also criminal activities of miscreants in the place,” Attah said.
