The Abubakar Saraki Campaign Advocacy Committee has called on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to focus on producing a credible presidential candidate to contest at the 2023 general election instead of talking about zoning. The group stated this while in Jalingo, Taraba State capital yesterday to seek for the PDP delegates votes at the forthcoming presidential primary elections of the party. The group led by Prof Iorwuese Hagher said Abubakar Saraki is the best candidate Nigeria needs at the moment to rescue the country from the seven years misrule of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Hagher while addressing journalists after a two hours close door meeting with the Taraba State Working Committee of the PDP, urged Nigerians to take stocks of the APC’s mismanagement of economic, security and welfare of the people and vote for credible presidential candidate like Abubakar Saraki. “We are here to present a new Nigeria of a different country for you, a Nigeria where all system will work, our children will go back to universities, now, our people are living like bush animals, the old system must die, we must go for democracy where laws are obeyed. “We are swimming in terrible loans, PDP came some years ago and clear Nigeria loans, there is massive corruption at the highest level within the seven years of APC, Saraki is capable of taking Nigeria to a better level. “We present a leader who is energetic, educated and up to date with the modern world, he is coming not to make money for himself, Nigeria is sick and need a good Doctor like Saraki. PDP must choose the best presidential candidate, not to be discussing zoning now that Nigerians are looking for credible president to take over power from APC,” he said.
