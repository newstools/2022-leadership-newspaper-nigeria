As the 2022 national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) gets underway, critical stakeholders of the party in Abia State have approached a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, calling for the disqualification of the Chief Ikechi Emenike-led faction of party from the Saturday’s exercise. The stakeholders led by Mr Ibe Ogwuma in a suit No: FCT /HC/CV/1012/2022, demanded for an order dissolving what they called purported congresses conducted by Emenike and ha cronies. Also joined in the originating summons as respondents were Chief Friday Nwosu and Ikenna Anyalewachi. The stakeholders also prayed for an order restraining Chief Kingsley Ononugbu from parading himself as the Abia State chairman of APC, being a product of the aforementioned “kankaroo” congress. The stakeholders agued that the duo lacked the powers to validly produce and present list of delegates to the APC national convention on behalf of the state chapter of the party. The stakeholders also called for an order directing the APC not to associate, discuss or collect any convention list or its like from Emenike and Ononugbu. Among the prayers were an order mandating the National Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress led by Governor Mai Mala Buni to install a caretaker committee of APC in Abia State branch as recommended by an APC reconciliatory committee. In a separate suit No: FCT/HC/CV M/3785/2022, Ogwuma also sought an interim injunction restraining the APC from associating, discussing or collecting any convention list or it’s like from Emenike and Ononugbo pending the determination of the substantive suit before the court. It also sought an interim order restraining Ononugbu from parading himself ass the state chairman of the party on the basis that he is a product of a kangaroo congress.
