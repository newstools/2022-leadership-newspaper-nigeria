A group of young Nigerians under the auspices of #TakeBackNaija# Movement has promised the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of over 10million votes at the 2023 presidential election, should the party present former Anambra State governor, Mr Peter Obi, as the party’s flag bearer. The national coordinator of the group Comrade Ali Mohammad, who made this known in Yenagoa after an interactive session with youth groups and other stakeholders ahead of the party’s primaries, pleaded with the PDP leadership to consider Peter Obi as the presidential flag bearer, considering the fact that what is at stake in 2023 is beyond party politics, but a case of rescuing the country. Mohammad stressed further that Nigeria was in dire need of a competent leader who has track records of integrity in public office, after the current All Progressives Congress (APC) disastrous seven years that have seen the country crumbling in virtually every sector, including the oil and gas sector, where the nation’s economy revolves. #TakeBackNaija# Movement, in the statement made available to newsmen in Yenagoa, pointed out that they are already mobilizing young and qualified Nigerians across the nooks and crannies of the country to join the movement, as they have identified the former vice presidential candidate of the PDP at the 2019 elections, Mr Peter Obi, as the best presidential material in the party currently. They therefore pleaded with the PDP to adopt him as their consensus candidate ahead of 2023, as he has what it takes to turn the tides of the country around, going by his past record as the governor of Anambra State, and most importantly his vast knowledge of economic policy, good governance, and purposeful leadership, which is what the country is lacking at the moment. The group also noted that PDP has a track record of ensuring equity and justice since her formation and as such, should use this golden opportunity to give the Igbos a sense of belonging, having not had the opportunity to produce either a president or vice president since the return of democracy in 1999. Comrade Mohammed through the statement pointed out that Peter Obi is the most popular candidate amongst the Nigerian youths, as well as the elites, and most importantly, is acceptable across the six geopolitical zones, that are yearning for a credible, visionary and passionate leader, who will transform the fortunes of the country, once given the opportunity. He reiterated that research carried out shows that young persons would troop out en masse to vote in 2023, if the party presents them with a candidate that represents the interest of the youths, and has a plan to revive the country’s dying economy.
