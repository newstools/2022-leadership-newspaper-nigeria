Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals Plc said, it will raise its manufacturing capacity by 300 per cent this year on the completion of its ongoing facility upgrade at its Lagos factory. This was made known by the managing director/CEO of the Company, Pharm Matthew Azoji at the Annual General Meeting(AGM) of the company held in Lagos. Speaking to shareholders who were excited at the growing prospects of the company, Azoji said, the capacity upgrade would increase the turnover and profits of Neimeth. “Last year the Company announced a two-pronged expansion programme; to build a new manufacturing plant at Amawbia in Anambra State and a facility upgrade of its Oregun plant. The facility upgrade is now nearing completion while work at the new plant is getting to an advanced stage,” he said The fortunes of Neimeth have taken an upward turn since 2018 when it returned to profitability after nearly a decade of predominantly losses. From a loss of N404.9 million in 2017 the Company made profit of N166.4 million in 2018, N304.4 million in 2019, N297.3 million in 2020 at the upsurge of COVID pandemic and N365.2 million in 2021. The chairman of the board of Neimeth, Dr. Ambrosie Orjiako, said, the board is working with management to ensure that the growth trajectory is sustained. According to Orijiako, “Neimeth has emerged from an era of constant losses to a period of steady growth in both turnover and profitability. In the past three years the company has built a regime of growth and profitability. “In the 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 business years the company recorded growth in both turnover and profit after ten years of lull.” Following the same growth trajectory, the share price of Neimeth increased 343 per cent from 40 kobo as at September 30, 2019 to N1.77 as at March 14, 2022. Between 2012 and 2021 the earnings per share of Neimeth grew 280 per cent from negative five kobo to 14 kobo per share. The ability of the company to create wealth for shareholders has been applauded by industry and market watchers and regulators. The company has equally transited from non-dividend payment which lasted for a decade to one of consistent payment of dividend to shareholders.
