The minister of youth and sports development, Chief Sunday Dare, has inaugurated the new board of Badminton Federation of Nigeria (BFN) that will be piloting the affairs of the federation in the next four years. The BFN election held at the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development Abuja yesterday saw the incumbent Barrister Francis Orbih returned unopposed as the president while Maina Muhammed was also elected unopposed as the new vice president. Recall that the election of the board of the Badminton Federation of Nigeria was put on hold due to the court injunction that was instituted by some aggrieved stakeholders stopping the elections early fixed  September 30, 2021 in Abuja. Inaugurating the board in Abuja yesterday, Sports Minister Sunday Dare charged the Francis Orbih-led board of BFN to deepening the development of badminton in the country. “As president, vice president and members of the Badminton Federation of Nigeria, the task of deepening the development of the sport now lies squarely on your shoulders,” Dare said. The Minister, who was represented by the permanent secretary, Alhaji Sumaila Abubakar, stated further: “Teamwork is key to achieving the board’s goals and objectives. I salute the sheer sense of patriotism, with which each of you voluntarily contested to be part of the national assignment, which comes without any form of remuneration. “I charge you to be guided by the established processes, procedures, and the code of governance of National Sports Federations in the discharge of your responsibilities. You are required to bring your BFN constitution to align with the Ministry’s 2021 Code of Governance before the end of June 2022.” In his remarks, the new president, Barrister Francis Orbih, said: “We are committed to lifting badminton after many issues that confronted the federation. “We would continue as one family, reach out to everyone to join hands and lift badminton. We know that we lost the ground recently but we will come back strong.”
