He was sworn in by the state chief judge, Justice Onochie Anyachebelu, at exactly 9:45am, at the Anambra State Government House, Awka. The event was witnessed by several dignitaries, including the outgone governor, Chief Obiano and his wife, Mrs Ebelechukwu Obiano, and all the 30 members of the Anambra State House of Assembly. Immediately after taking over, the governor inspected the guard of honour, which was his first task as governor of the state. He promised in his inaugural address to work hard to make Anambra proud. He promised further to ensure maximum utilisation of the paltry funds of the state in the interest of the people. He said that the day of his swearing was not a day for celebration because of three reasons. He said that there is no venue large enough to the contain the hundreds of thousands of people in the state; the State cannot afford such a waste and he does not subscribe to spending the people’s money on a fleeting celebration. “I will rather use such resources to lay the foundation for a public hospital at Okpoko and elsewhere,” he. saidl He remembered the three policemen who were killed during a consultative meeting in his community in 2021 and promised to take care of those they left behind. “I reported at work for 8:55am and will work for eight hours,” he added. The governor had earlier stated that immediately after swearing-in, he would proceed to Okpoko, a sprawling slum, near Onitsha, where he would spend eight hours, working to provide a better living for the people.
