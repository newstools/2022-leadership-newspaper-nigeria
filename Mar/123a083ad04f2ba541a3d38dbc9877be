Mpakaboari Long John Foundation (MLJ FDN) said its music academy will soon commence operations for aspiring creatives and established artistes looking to gain world-class skills and career advancement. This groundbreaking initiative is set to support talented musicians who are early in their professional Afrobeats, Pop, RnB, and world music careers. MLJFDN will welcome applications from artistes early in their career, regardless of instrument or genre, and aims to support them during the fragile early stages of their professional careers, helping them gain recognition within the music industry. MLJ academy offers free, practical short courses covering all aspects of music production and media content production, including beat making, directing, producing, editing, sound, and lighting. Designed by local and foreign industry experts, the courses are designed to help working music professionals improve their skills and make them globally competitive, and to equip beginners with the skills they need to launch their careers. MLJ Foundation is a global movement committed to positive representation — and also connected artists and brands for music and product launches in the past. It has many talents as part of its community and is focused on music-driven influencer campaigns. According to the founder of the non-profit organisation, Ambassador Mpakaboari LongJohn, there are many new essential and rising artists poised to make a major impact in the music industry and they will be trained and get the required helps. “We have so much talent in Nigeria and our people are ready to work. Unfortunately, very little training is available locally and most people cannot afford to go abroad for training. Our academy is meant to fill that gap and make world-class training available,” Ambassador Mpaka announced on Instagram.
