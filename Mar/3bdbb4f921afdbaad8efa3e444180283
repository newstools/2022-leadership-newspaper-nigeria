A criminal suspect, Chinwe Okwuegbunwa, alias Mano has gunned down a policeman, simply identified as Cyprian in Awarra community of Ohaji-Egbema local government area of Imo State. Eyewitnesses who pleaded anonymity said a team of policemen had come to effect the arrest of Mano over allegation of being a wanted person by the police. Mano resisted and started dragging the rifle with Cyprian and in the process cocked the gun and shot him. He reportedly died on the spot. It took the spirited efforts of the other policemen who accompanied Cyprian to disarm Mano and effect his arrest as he tried to escape but the villagers resisted. Sources said villagers, for fear of reprisal attacks struggled with the suspect, overpowered him and handed him over to the Police team for prosecution. Already, villagers have started fleeing the community for fear of attacks from cult members and the Police. Efforts to get the confirmation from Imo State Police Spokesperson, Michael Abattam proved abortive as he didn’t take the calls put across to him.
