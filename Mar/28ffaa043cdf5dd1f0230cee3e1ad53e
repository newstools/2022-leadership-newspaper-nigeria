Ekiti State Youth Parliament has called on the state Governor Dr Kayode Fayemi, to ensure that killers of Oluwabamise Ayanwole , a passenger and native of Ekiti State who was allegedly slain in Lagos after boarding Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) are fished out and prosecuted. The speaker of the parliament, Rt. Hon. Toba Fatunla, said the leadership of the parliament made the demand on at an emergency meeting in Ado Ekiti, the state capital. Fatunla said that the deceased deserves justice and called on the governor to use his office to Intervene in the matter. He said, “The news of the death of Bamise, an Ekiti born, precisely Moba local indigene in a BRT of death in Lagos is most unfortunate and disheartening, it shows how our society has degraded and the country becoming increasingly unsafe for the youth. “We call on the governor of Ekiti and her excellency, Erelu Bisi Fayemi to intervene and not allow this incident swept under the carpet. The life of every Ekiti youth any where matters and we cannot therefore keep quiet while one of us is killed mysteriously.” They went further to appeal to the Governor to prioritise welfarism of Ekiti Youth, engage them more and enhance their capacity before the expiration of his tenure.
