Concerned Northern APC Youth Forum has urged supporters of Engr. David Umahi, to remain calm over the judgement which asked him to vacate office as governor of Ebonyi State. Recall that the Federal High Court in Abuja had on Tuesday ordered Umahi and his deputy to leave office over their defection from PDP to APC. Umahi has however appealed the judgement. But the convener and chairman of the Concerned Northern APC Youth Forum Hon. Suleiman Liba said the governor was experiencing a trying moment. He said “I want everyone to understand that this is not the end of it all, we all need to be strong, focused and be prayerful at this moment as this too shall come to pass,” he said. “We have spoken to His Excellency, he is calm and he appeals for calm as well, from all his supporters as all relevant stakeholders are already on top of the situation. At the end of it all we are confident it will end in victory,” he said.
