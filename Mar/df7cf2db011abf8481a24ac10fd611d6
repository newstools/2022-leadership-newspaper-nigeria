A statement by the media adviser to the Senate Presiden, Ola Awoniyi, on Monday, quoted Lawan as saying: “I heartily felicitate the National Leader of our great party, Asiwaju Tinubu on this occasion of his birthday. “I join members of his family, friends, political associates and numerous well-wishers across and outside of Nigeria in rejoicing with Asiwaju for reaching this milestone in sound health of body and mind. “Asiwaju Tinubu has lived a life of service, impacting many lives in several decades of active political participation and public service. “This has made him a political pathfinder, leader of leaders and a legend in his own lifetime. “Today, he is not just a principal actor in Nigerian politics, but also one of the main issues. “I wish the Jagaban Borgu a happy birthday and many more years of impactful service to our beloved fatherland, Nigeria, and its great people.”
