The Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN) says it has disbursed more than N62.5billion to female entrepreneurs in Nigeria as at February 2022. Managing director of the bank Mr Tony Okpanachi made this disclosure in Abuja yesterday when the bank celebrated the International Women’s Day. Okpanachi stated that “gender equity is crucial to meeting development goals, reducing human suffering, and solving our biggest environmental problems”. Women across the world, he said “continue to suffer from gender inequality, including child labour, forced marriages, gender-based violence, sexist policies, as well as barriers to participation in education and employment”. Okpanachi identified the stereotypes and biases that women have to contend with to include “Women Can’t Be Leaders; Women Are Irrational; Women Can’t Handle Huge Responsibilities and many more”. For a society to make progress, Okpanachi stated that “we must challenge these preconceived notions”. As chief executive officer of the Development Bank of Nigeria Plc, he said he has led “a team that is deliberately breaking these biases”. This he said “is anchored on the appreciation and recognition of the strategic role women play as reliable builders of micro, small, and medium scale enterprises, a segment we are mandated to provide funding to”. Okpanachi noted that “it is admirable that we are now challenging these biases, especially in the workplace; we must also be aware of the unintended consequence of this new level of openness and embrace it with optimism instead of fear”.
