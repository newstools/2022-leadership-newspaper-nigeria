Popular Kannywood actress, Rahama Sadau, on Wednesday, disclosed how she was saved from the Abuja-Kaduna train attack. Recall that terrorists on Monday night attacked a Kaduna bound train after bombing the rail which forced the train to a halt. It was gathered that the terrorists attacked the coaches before forcefully gaining access which led to the death of some passengers, while several others were injured and many others abducted. The actress in a post on her Twitter account disclosed that she was scheduled to be on the train with her sister but they missed it. Sadau, however, noted that she had friends who boarded the train and were victims of the attack. She wrote, “Myself and my sister were to be on the attacked train last night but we missed it. WE MISSED IT!! It could’ve been me & mine but it’s actually Us… We had friends & family on that train. WHEN IS THIS EVER GONNA STOP??? #KadunaTrainAttack.” The award winning actress, however, took the opportunity to call on Nigerians to get their voters card. Sadau said, “It can only get worse as the elections are fast approaching & the target will always be Arewa… I would say get your PVC and vote wisely but VOTE FOR WHO? The same set of people ??? Still get that PVC PLEASE!!! #KadunaTrainAttack “We (AREWA) brought this h*ll upon ourselves, we chose to be suppressed because we are scared. But also failed to realise that the power is actually in our hands… We don’t want to shamefully admit that our leaders have failed us but THEY HAVE!!! “Today, With the amount of security personnel at MKO Abiola Stadium, I Came to realise that Nigeria is capable of doing whatever it feels like but “they” just chose to ignore the killings, the whole goddamn security sector. #KadunaTrainAttack.”
