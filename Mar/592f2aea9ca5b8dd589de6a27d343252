The Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers(NCRIB) has  sympathised with the Lagos state government and the victims of the Apongbon fire disaster where valuables worth millions of naira were destroyed, even as it underscored the value of insurance. The president of the council, Mr. Rotimi Edu, in a sympathy letter to the governor of Lagos state, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu said, the council was pained by the avoidable disaster, especially at a time when the state government was deploying all strategies towards protecting lives and properties of Lagosians. Edu said, the fire disaster speaks to the need for government to accelerate sanitary initiatives, especially, in vulnerable areas of the state and embark on more aggressive public campaigns on how the citizens could become more responsible for their assets and those of the government. The NCRIB president utilised the opportunity to underscore the critical place of insurance in risk mitigation, particularly in the protection of assets of the lowly in market places. “With this, government should turn more attention on insurance of markets across the country, in order to provide safety and succor the victims in the event of the aftermath of losses to human and material assets as this case in point” Edu asserted
