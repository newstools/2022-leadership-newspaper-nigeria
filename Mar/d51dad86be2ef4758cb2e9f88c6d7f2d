Ekiti State governor and chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Kayode Fayemi, has denied ever objecting to the consensus arrangement being championed by the number one leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), President Muhammadu, ahead of the party’s March 26 national convention. In a press statement late Thursday night titled, ‘Re: Fayemi Rejects Consensus Candidates’, signed by the chief press secretary to Governor Fayemi, Yinka Oyebode, he said the earlier news report was a misrepresentation of the views of the governor as he was quoted out of context. “The general public is hereby notified that a news story in circulation with the above headline is a misrepresentation of the views of the Governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi. “Dr Fayemi at a policy dialogue organised by the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) in Abuja on Thursday, was quoted as rejecting the consensus arrangement President Mohammed Buhari reached with the Governors ahead of the party’s convention. “It must be stated, however, that Governor Fayemi’s presentation at the event was about democracy in West Africa and democratic reversal in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso and not about his party convention. “For the avoidance of doubt, Governor Fayemi in response to a question from the audience accusing the President of imposing a Chairman on the party at the forthcoming convention, stated that the President’s priority was the unity of the party and he didn’t know about the President endorsing any candidate for Chairman. But that if indeed the President has expressed such a view, the President that he knows is a democrat and those who do not share the view may of course contest. “Governor Fayemi is well known as a leader not given to frivolous and distracting talk,” Oyebode stated.
