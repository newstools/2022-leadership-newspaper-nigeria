The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has called off what it called a purported emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting slated for Thursday, March 17, 2022. A terse statement issued on Wednesday and signed by the national secretary of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, said the cancellation was a directive of the chairman of CECPC and Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, who is currently in London, United Kingdom. Governor Buni had earlier on Wednesday met with President Muhammadu Buhari, who is currently on a medical vacation, in London over party issues. “As directed by the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe State, H.E. Mai Mala Buni, a purported emergency meeting of the  Party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) slated for Thursday, March 17, 2022 is hereby cancelled,” Akpanudoedehe stated. Recall that last week Monday, a member of the CECPC and Niger State governor, Abubakar Sani-Bello, who dramatically stormed the national secretariat of the party in Abuja and thereafter claimed chairmanship of the APC, had summoned an emergency NEC meeting slated for Thursday, March 17.
