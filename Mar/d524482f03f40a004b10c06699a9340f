The newly elected president of the Nigerian Universities Games Association (NUGA) Emeka Ogbu, has said he would make the games a scouting ground for the various sports to pick representatives for the country. Ogbu who was inaugurated as the President of NUGA during the 26th edition of the games in Lagos stated this on Monday in a chat with newsmen in Benin City where he said that his experience as the 1st Vice President under the immediate past President, Stephen Hamafyelto has prepared him for what it takes to achieve this through the organization of the games at a very high level. Ogbu promised to work together with various Directors of Sports in affiliate Universities to ensure the next NUGA games have the best of organisation and innovative ideas. He said “We will collaborate and bring the best of brains to raise the bar in terms of preparation and sourcing for partnerships to improve the quality of our sporting competitions.” It would be recalled that Ogbu was returned unopposed to become the new NUGA President after his only opponent, Nnadozie Cliford of Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Abia State, voluntarily stepped down from the race.
