The Party has already appointed Caretaker Committees at state and National levels with the mandate of, among other things, conducting congresses and convention for the purpose of electing substantive executives.” The chairman who also announced the formation of national caretaker committee to include, Dr Boniface Aniebonam at Board of Trustees (BOT) chairman; AVM John Chris Ifeimeje, national chairman; Sen Suleiman Hunkuyi, deputy chairman, Oladipo Olayoku, national secretary; Dr Ajuji Ahmed, deputy national secretary; Major Gilbert Agbo, national publicity secretary; and Prof Rufai Ahmed Alkali as national organising secretary.
