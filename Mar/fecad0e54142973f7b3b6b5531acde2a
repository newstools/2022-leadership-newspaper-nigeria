He said, “Though your son Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, is also nursing ambition to contest, both Tambuwal and Saraki have what it takes to lead the country. “Tambuwal as a lawyer, former speaker of house of representative and also a governor is qualified but Saraki on the other hand a medical doctor, former Governor and Senate President will rescue Nigeria from this present situation. Agbo maintained that Nigerians have never been divided along political, ethno-religious lines, as is it now. He further narrated that, “Nigerians elected Buhari who is from the North thinking he has capacity to lead the nation but he has failed the nation. “This is a President who insulted Nigeria youths that they are lazy because of his incompetency to provide employment for the teeming youth of the country. “Nigerians did not vote for insecurity, nepotism, economic woes and unemployment. Nigeria is at the brink of collapse and it is only the PDP that can rescue it.” Responding, the Chairman of PDP in Sokoto State, Honourable Bello Aliyu Goronyo, thanked the delegation for visiting Sokoto and urged them to continue to canvas for more support. He stressed that whoever emerged as PDP presidential candidate of PDP would definitely become the president of this country.
