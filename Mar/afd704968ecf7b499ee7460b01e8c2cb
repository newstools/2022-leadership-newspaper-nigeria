Ebonyi State government has sealed four hotels within the Abakaliki metropolis for refusing to pay ground rates. After sealing the hotels, the special adviser to the governor on lands and survey, Chief Emmanuel Igwe, told journalists that the enforcement for the payment of ground rates had commenced in the state. He warned that any hotel or property owner that fails to comply with the government’s directive will have his or her property sealed without delay. The affected hotels are CLEVERO Hotel, Abuson Hotel, Island Comfort Hotel and City Pride Hotel. According to him, “We are in the process of enforcing the payment of ground rate by landlords and property owners. “Ground rate is the annual due that those that have Certificate of Occupancy, C of O, pay to the state government on yearly basis.” He said that the hotels were given notices to pay their ground rates but for those that are yet to pay, they have commenced the processes of sealing their hotels, until all necessary payments are made. “Today we were able to seal the CEVERO Hotel, Abuson Hotel, Inland Comfort, and City Pride Hotel. It’s a continuous process. We are still going to seal more. The remaining ones that we are to visit, if we could visit and they are yet to pay, we will deal. “And I want to use this opportunity to call on landlords, especially business owners, filling station owners to pay up because very soon I will visit them and if you don’t pay, we will seal your property. “It has nothing to do with party affiliation. It has nothing to do with status in society,” he said.
