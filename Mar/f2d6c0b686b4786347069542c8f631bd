Fear has griped residents of the 23 local goverment areas of Kaduna State, as they mourn the death of over 100 innocent people killed by bandits in Giwa, Jema’a and Kaura local government areas of the State. Bandits had, on Sunday, attacked residents of Kagoro community, in Kaura LGA, killing over 34, burning several houses and kidnapping others. A day after the killing, youths who blocked the road in protest, also killed two locals. However, three days after, bandits in a large number, reportedly stormed nine villages in Giwa local government area of the State, and killed over 50 residents, burning several houses, churches and kidnapping several others. They also reportedly rustled cattles, household animals and several livestock. Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, in a statement, on Friday, said the State government was awaiting security report on the incident. According to a resident, Dr. Lawal Abdullahi, a medical doctor, bandits have taken over Kaduna State. “They unleash mayhem at the slightest provocation. They choose where to storm, kill, kidnap, demand for ransom at the very presence of security operatives,” he said. Also, Mrs. Jessica Mohmo, a secondary school teacher, told Newspot that no one can guarantee safety in Kaduna any longer. According to her, self-defense was now necessary because even the security operatives were helpless. Another resident of Kagoro, Mr. Yohanna Makus, who said IDPs camps in Kagoro is filled to capability, the State Government is confused over the bandits’ attack. “Criminal attack in Kaduna State has gained ground. It will be difficult for Government to bring this under control, because many people are helping bandits to succeed. “Informants give detailed information to bandits, but it’s difficult to trace who is an informant among residents of a community,” he said. According to him, since there are no new jobs, many unemployed youths are into various criminal activities.
