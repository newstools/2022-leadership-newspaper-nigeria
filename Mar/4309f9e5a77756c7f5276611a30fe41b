The National League of Veteran Journalists (NALVEJ) in Kwara State has urged the federal government to urgently find a solution to the lingering fuel crisis in the country. The league noted that Nigerians, especially the people of Kwara State are going through harrowing experiences as a result of fuel shortage. This formed part of the resolutions reached at the end of the monthly meeting of the league, held on Wednesday in Ilorin, Kwara State. In a statement issued at the end of the meeting and signed by the chairman, Alh Tunde Akanbi and the publicity  secretary, Alhaji Abdullahi Olesin, the league lamented that the intense  heat being experienced in Ilorin has further compounded the residents woes. It noted that the recent motor accident that occurred at the airport area in Ilorin, which claimed nine lives was as a result of the fuel scarcity which forced one of the  drivers of the vehicles involved in the accident to harbour kegs of  petroleum in his vehicle. It also blamed the fuel scarcity for the death of a man  who fell  from a two- storey building after sleeping in the corridor of his house  in Ilorin because of heat. The league asked the government at all levels  to monitor the activities of fuel marketers and ensure that they dispense the fuel in their tanks and at the official pump price.
