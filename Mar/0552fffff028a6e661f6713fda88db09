Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello has expressed satisfaction with the ongoing work at the International Market and Motor park in Suleja Local Government Area of the State, saying it will soon start operation. The governor made the expression after an inspection of the facilities at the ongoing construction site of the market and park in Suleja. He said when completed, the project will improve economic activities and reduce hardship of the people especially commuters who go to distant parks to board vehicles as well as boost the Internally generated revenue of the state. Governor Bello said “It’s a very nice job, it took time but at the end, we have seen results. A city like Suleja needs projects like this to boost business activities. “Going forward the road arouud the market area would be expanded because the population and economic activities are increasing by the day”, The governor however observed that the facility lacks emergency exit in case of fire outbreak and road network and therefore called for adjustment. The Project Head, International Market and Motor park Suleja Aminu Umaru Yanda while speaking to newsmen, said the project which started since 2014 has attained over 80 percent completion. The State commissioner for Investment, Dr Mustapha Jibrin, said the facility will soon be put to use and will be partially run by the state for a short time before handing it over to private sector operators to manage. “Mainly it’s going to be leased out to the private sector to run it. Government is going to run the hotel and the terminal for like one year to help government know how much income it would expect from the project and help in negotiating with private sector. And we believe that the private sector will run it much better,” he said.
