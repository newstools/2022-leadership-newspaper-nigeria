A former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has resigned his membership from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP). Kwankwaso’s defection from PDP was contained in a letter dated March 29, 2022 and addressed to his ward chairman of the party. Part of the letter reads: “It is with deep sense of responsibility that I write to notify you, that as a result of some serious and irreconcilable differences, I have reached the conclusion that my continued stay in the PDP is untenable and therefore effective from today, Tuesday 29th day of March, 2022, I have withdrawn my membership form the Peoples’ Democratic Party, PDP.” The development has laid to rest speculations that he was leaving the party. Kwankwaso, who represented Kano Central in the 8th Senate, had also announced that he would join a third force movement called New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP).
