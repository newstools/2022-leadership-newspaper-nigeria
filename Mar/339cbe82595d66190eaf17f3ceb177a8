 There was disbelief at the inauguration of Prof. Charles Chukwuma Soludo as the new governor of Anambra State when the wife of the outgone Governor Willie Obiano, Mrs Ebelechukwu, slapped Ambassador Bianca Ojukwu at the event on Thursday.   The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) correspondent who was at the scene of the event reports that the incident occurred immediately after Soludo took his oath of office. NAN reports that dignitaries, including the immediate-past Governor Obiano were already seated when Mrs. Obiano stepped in and moved to the front row where Mra Ojukwu, the widow of the late Biafran Leader, Dim Odumegwu Ojukwu, was seated and allegedly slapped her. The action drew the attention of security agents and some personalities who pulled Mrs. Obiano off the hold of Ojukwu, who was visibly shocked at the action. Mrs. Obiano was later taken away and shortly afterwards, her husband left the venue since the incident happened after the new governor had been sworn in.
