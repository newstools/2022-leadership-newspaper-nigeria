Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has declared President Muhammadu Buhari as “Father of Modern Nigeria” because of the massive infrastructure development embarked upon by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The group’s director and founder, Professor Ishaq Akintola disclosed this to newsmen after a picnic in which the group travelled on the new train procured by the President Buhari-led government from Lagos to Ibadan. At the end of the trip, MURIC declared Buhari as a true leader. The group’s vice chairman in Oyo State, Barrister Abdul Wahid Lawal, said “14 members from the Lagos branch of MURIC left Lagos by 8.30 am on board the Buhari train from the Babatunde Fashola Station, Agege, Lagos. They were accompanied by three journalists. “Members from the Ogun State chapter of MURIC joined the team at the Wole Soyinka Station, Abeokuta, making the number of picnickers 22. While the Lagos team was led by the group’s director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, the Ogun State chapter was led by its chairman, Alhaji Tajudeen Jimoh. “They arrived at the Obafemi Awolowo Station, Moniya, Ibadan, around 11 am. They were received by 15 members from the Oyo State chapter of the organisation. The team from Ibadan was led by the vice chairman of the branch, Barrister Abdul Wahid Lawal. “The picnic began immediately after arriving in Ibadan. The event afforded members of MURIC from the three branches in Lagos, Ogun and Oyo, to get to know one another and to cross-fertilize ideas.”
