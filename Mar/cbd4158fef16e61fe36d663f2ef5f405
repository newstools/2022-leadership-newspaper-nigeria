The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has granted the immediate-past governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano, bail after spending about five days in custody. EFCC chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, who stated this in Abuja, however, said the former governor was yet to perfect his bail conditions. Speaking with journalists on the sideline of 5th Annual General Assembly (AGA) of the Network of Anti-Corruption Institutions in West Africa (NACIMA) on Monday, Bawa said the former governor will be in the custody of the commission until he fulfills his bail conditions. The NACIWA Assembly was co-hosted by both the EFCC and the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC). Recall that the embattled former governor was nabbed on Thursday last week at about 8:30pm by the anti-graft agency at Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos when he was on his way to the United States of America after handing over to the new governor in Anambra state. Obiano was subsequently transferred to the headquarters of the commission in Abuja, where he was quizzed for days over alleged mismanagement of N42bn and contract inflation. Meanwhile, Bawa, in an address he delivered at the NACIWA, said the EFCC had within last year, secured an unprecedented conviction record of 2,220 and recoveries in excess of N152billion and $386milion, among other recoveries. He said: “The Commission has also embarked on several reforms aimed at strengthening the institution, including the development of a reporting application named Eagle Eye, to ease the reporting of incidences of economic and financial crimes by the public. “The EFCC has further developed a five-year Strategic Plan that guides its operational approach in law enforcement action.”
