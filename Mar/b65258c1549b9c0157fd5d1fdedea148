Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, has sacked some members of the Federal House of Representatives from Cross River State and State House of Assembly, who defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The court gave the order in a judgement in a suit by the PDP seeking the removal of the Cross River federal and state legislators, who defected from PDP to the APC. In his judgement on the originating summon marked ABJ/FHC/CS/976/21, filed in August 2021 by the PDP, the court held that, “The action of the 5th to the 25th Defendants is feeble and constitutes an attempt to pull a wool in the eyes of the court. “Their counter affidavit is manifestly defective,” Justice Taiwo held. Consequently, the court granted all the reliefs sought by the PDP, warning politicians to know that power belongs to the electorate.
