Sowore who declared his interest under the platform of the African Action Congress (ACC), said he is in the race to restructure Nigeria and rescue democracy from the hands of gerontocracy. The publisher added that he will give Nigeria a new constitution that empowers referendum and guarantees  self determination rights.  Addressing his supporters at the Take It Back Movement annual symposium yesterday in Abuja, Sowore said he is continuing his unfinished 2019 presidential race to establish democracy that will give justice to all. He said, “I want to assure you that power has changed hands today and we are going in the right direction, I want to assure you that the old ones who are holding us to ransom will be retired from politics today. “After 2019 elections, we started consultation with the people of Nigeria over poverty, jobs, electricity and others and we have reached out to our brothers in the south-east Nigeria, so we will make sure Nigeria work for everybody.” The presidential hopeful also said he will declare free and qualitative education for all children, give living wage to Nigerian workers and create massive jobs for the unemployed youth among others.
