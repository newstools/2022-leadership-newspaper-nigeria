Recent allegations against the Project Development Institute (PRODA), National Assembly, Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) and Federal Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation have been declared false, fictitious and fake. The Coalition of Civil Society Organizations in Nigeria (COCSON) stated this yesterday in Abuja. Addressing newsmen in Abuja, the executive secretary of the group, Engr Tijani Ali Danjuma, said before they drew conclusion that the allegations against these organizations were not correct, they embarked on independent findings to unravel the truth behind the issues. He said: “Sequel to numerous allegations levelled against the former board chairman of PRODA,  Mr Daniel Onjei  by the management of PRODA and contractors and the  accusations against the former director general of  PRODA and other  former members of the  Governing Board,  the then director general, Dr Charles Agulana,  was suspended and Daniel Onjeh was also asked to step aside  by the  Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (OSGF)  pending the outcome of the findings of the investigation. “It is important to highlight here that the Federal Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (FMSTI) never asked these persons to step aside but were ordered to do so by the president through the Office of the Secretary to the Government of The Federation (OSGF).” COCSON also reacted to the allegation that Dr Chima Igwe’s certificate was fake, adding that some bodies had investigated and discovered that his certificate is correct.
