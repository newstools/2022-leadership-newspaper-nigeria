A student of Kinsey College of Education, Ilorin, Kwara State, Yakubu Ahmed, has been arraigned before an Ilorin Magistrate’s court for allegedly causing the death of his friend. The accused and his late colleague, Faruq Ahmed, were said to have engaged in physical combat during which they used knives to inflict injuries on each other. The Police First Information Report (FIR) stated that the fight between the duo ensued as a result of missing food plates kept in the custody of the deceased. LEADERSHIP gathered that the accused and the deceased were rushed to the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) for treatment, but Ahmed later died as a result of the injuries he sustained during the physical combat. In his ruling, the trial Magistrate Adebayo Kudus said he could only take cognizance of the the case as his court lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the matter. He ordered that the accused should be remanded at a Correctional Centre and adjourned the matter till March 21, 2022 for mention.
