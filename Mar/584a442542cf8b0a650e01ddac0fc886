Massive infrastructure development, especially road construction in Kwara south, has forced down the prices of
food items in the area. For instance, tubers of yam that were sold for N2,000 before the construction of the new roads now sell for N700
because of easy access to farm sites. Residents and motorists plying the newly reconstructed roads in the zone have heaved a sigh of relief and thanked the state government for its kind gesture. One of the road projects that has brought succour to the residents of the area is the long abandoned 2.3 kilometer Oro-Ago- Oyate asphalt road project in Ifelodun local government area of the state. Deputy chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in Oro- Ago, Mr Oladiran Aweda confirmed to LEADERSHIP that the new state of Oro-Ago/ Oyate road has forced down the prices of
farm produce. Aweda said the transporters have reduced the transport fares in the area and this has also resulted in farmers
reducing the prices of farm produce. He, however, appealed to the governor, AbdulRahaman AbdulRazaq to assist the transporters in procuring
new vehicles to further boost economic activities of the people of Irepodun local government area. He said two tubers of yam that were sold for N2,000 before the road was constructed now sell for N700
because of easy access to farm site. “We want to appeal to governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq to assist us with vehicles so that we can ply the
route.
