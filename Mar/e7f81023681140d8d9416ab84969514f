Speaking during the coronation ceremony yesterday in Jabi-Life camp area of the territory, chairman of Yoruba Council of Obas in Abuja, Oba Olusegun Salau, commended the NCWS president for outstanding work and contributions to the development of society. “As she attains this Erelu, it’s for throughout her lifetime and I pray that God will guide her in whatever she does in life. So far, she has been doing very well and she has to continue to do so in her endeavours,” he said. Also, Oba Alaa, the custodian of Yoruba culture and religion in the FCT, Olubukola Falade, said the  Erelu chieftaincy title means ‘a mother of all.’ “She has been with us, we know her very well and she is a caring mother in all aspects. We pray to God Almighty to sustain her on this throne,” he said. Dr. Shoda expressed gratitude to the monarchs for deeming it fit to give her the title. “I am really very grateful and highly honoured  and I say thank you to all the Yoruba community in Abuja. And my commitment is to work with the palace to uplift it as much as I can, work with the Yoruba community in Abuja and bring them together to be one, so that we can always speak with one voice especially the women,” she said.
