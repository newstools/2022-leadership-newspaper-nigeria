Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yoruba land, Iba Gani Adams, has urged the Olubadan of Ibadan land, Oba Lekan Balogun, not to ignore the core traditional rites and practices that made Ibadan what it is presently. Adams who gave the counsel while speaking at the grand finale of the 2022 edition of Oke’badan festival, held at Cultural Centre, Mokola, enjoined the monarch not to abandon the traditional rites and practices of the ancient town. He explained that the glory of Ibadan and the legacy must continue to thrive because cultural promotion was one of the tools for spiritual and physical liberation. He advised the Olubadan to sustain the values that made Ibadan the pride of all South-West states, adding that there was a need for the monarch to restore the glory of the ancient town by making Oke’badan festival one of the most colourful festivals in Nigeria and West Africa. Adams remarked that the stool of Olubadan of Ibadan land was purely traditional, adding that the monarch occupies a prominent place in the history of Yoruba land. The Aare Ona Kakanfo said that the burial of any Olubadan as a prominent monarch in Yoruba land should be more traditional than religious, saying that this was because the myth and respect that are attached to every Yoruba Obas across the southwest is legendary. “Paul Obi, Onyakhamoh and Mesioye, sometimes in 2022 in Lagos, with intent to defraud knowingly used a false document titled: ‘The Federal Republic of Nigeria companies and Allied Matters Act, 1990 Company Limited By Shares, Special Resolution of Dream World Leisure Limited dated 10th day of September 2020 at the Corporate Affairs Commission.
