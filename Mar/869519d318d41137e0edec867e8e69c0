Secretary-general of Commonwealth Handball Association (CHA) and former Nigerian international, Sheidu Jibrin Ojih, has called for an undisputed truce in the lingering leadership crisis rocking the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF). The leadership crisis in Nigeria’s basketball has refused to abate following the January 31, 2022 parallel elective congresses in Abuja and Benin that produced Mark Igoche and Musa Kida as two factional presidents respectively. But CHA boss, who spoke to LEADERSHIP Sports in Abuja recently, appealed to the contending factions to sheathe their swords and allow sanity to prevail in the beautiful game of basketball in the country. He described the continuous leadership impasse in NBBF as unhealthy for the development of basketball and Nigerian youth who depend on the game for their livelihood. “What is happening in basketball is not okay for all of us and it is not good for individuals to hold a federation to ransom. We are pleading and hope that the issue in basketball stops. “I play basketball at my secondary school level, it was basketball that dragged me into handball and we want to see a peaceful sports development in Nigeria. Negative politics have entered sports in Nigeria and the people encouraging this negativity are sports administrators without minding the interest of the youth that will be jeopardized. The youth depend on this sport for their livelihood and we shouldn’t selfishly destroy their function,” Jibrin appealed. Since 2017, Nigeria’s basketball has not known peace as the leadership tussle between Musa Kida and the group loyal to former president of NBBF, Tijani Umar, remained unresolved. The same scenario played out early this year as Kida was re-elected in Benin for a second term while his major opponent, Igoche Mark, was elected president in Abuja.
