Noor Takaful Insurance Limited, the pioneer composite Takaful Insurance firm in Nigeria, has kicked off roadshow activities in Kano to entrench and deepen penetration on Takaful insurance. The roadshow kicked off with a homage to the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, in his palace last Monday. Speaking during the visit, the vice chairman, Noor Takaful Insurance Limited, Aminu Tukur, who led the delegation to the Emir’s palace, stated that the visit to Emir was symbolic and significant to solicit the royal blessings and of the traditional ruler ahead of its planned roadshow activities. In his remarks, shortly after welcoming the visitors, the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Ado Bayero, commended the organization for bringing such an opportunity to the people of Kano State, particularly at a time when many Nigerians were looking for a viable alternative to conventional insurance. The Emir called on Nigerians to embrace the system of Takaful insurance given its immense benefits and acceptance in the Islamic world. He urged the organization to remain truthful to its promise in its dealings with people and its operations.
