The Federal Operations Unit (FOU) Zone C, of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), on Thursday, said it intercepted fake pharmaceutical products worth N192million in Okada, Edo State. In a press statement by the unit’s public relations officer, Jerry Attah, he said the 640 cartons of unregistered pharmaceuticals, worth N192 million, were conveyed in a DAF heavy duty truck and one J5 transit bus. Other unregistered pharmacuetical products intercepted are tramadol as well as other contraband goods with a Duty Paid Value of N529million between January 1 and February 28, 2022. The FOU C Comptroller, Mr Ali Ibrahim, made the disclosure while showcasing the seized items in Owerri on Thursday. Ibrahim added that six suspects were arrested during the period under review, however, adding that they had been granted administrative bail. He said 1,650 bales of used clothing valued at N165million were intercepted along the Umuikaa/Aba road  while 181 50kg bags of foreign parboiled rice worth over  N7.2 million were intercepted along the Akwa-Ibom/Calabar axis. Also intercepted were  2,239 pieces of used pneumatic tyres valued at N4.5million and  36,000 litres of smuggled petroluem products concealed in polyethylene bags, worth N3.6 illion. Also, eight exotic vehicles without relevant customs documents including three Toyota Hilux of 2017, 2020 and 2021 models; one Land Cruiser Prado 2016 model ; one Toyota Highlander 2014 and one Toyota Venza 2016 model, among others. “Similarly, I urge all economic saboteurs to turn a new leaf from their illegal business, as we are more resolute to ensure untiring implementation of  Government’s fiscal policy within our areas of coverage without any deterrence,” he said. He, however, called on traditional and religious leaders as well as other well-meaning Nigerians to advise their subjects and followers to desist from attacking security personnel, in the interest of peace and progress.
