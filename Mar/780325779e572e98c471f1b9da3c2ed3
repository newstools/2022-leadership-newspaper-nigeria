promoting the 2023 ambition of the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Shettima inaugurated the centre alongside another ally of Tinubu, Senator Abu Ibrahim and officials of the Asiwaju Beyond 2023 Project, during a brief ceremony in Abuja on Friday. Speaking at the event, Shettima expressed optimism that the centre would serve as a veritable platform for promoting the presidential aspiration of Tinubu. The lawmaker said Tinubu’s presidential campaign would be digitally driven given the Nigeria’s youthful population many of whom are digital-oriented. He said, “Ours is a young country, with about 70 per cent below the age of 35 years and most are digital-oriented. So, the digital platform is the best means of reaching the mass of Nigerian public. I believe this will be a major driving force to promote and realise the presidential ambition of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “The presidential bid of Asiwaju will be driven by digital instruments at our disposal. We believe that this (digital secretariat) is a veritable tool for adding value to the presidential aspiration of our principal.” Shettima hailed Asiwaju Tinubu, who is a former governor of Lagos State, as a politician who is pregnant with ideas on good governance and economic diversification, and tolerant of dissenting opinions. “The beauty of Asiwaju project is that he wants to continue from when President Buhari is going to stop. He’s not going to dissipate his useful time and energy on unnecessary recriminations,” he added. Earlier, the director-general of the centre, Barrister Realwan Okpanachi, said the group aimed to promote the presidential aspiration of Tinubu through an all-inclusive strategic and impressive issue-based campaign, and to deliberately engage, canvass, convince and mobilise men, women, youths, professionals, traders, and artisans towards ensuring their active and massive support for the APC national leader.
