An EFCC source said the former governor was arrested on his way out of Nigeria. LEADERSHIP reports that Obiano had earlier this Thursday completed his two-term tenure of eight years in office as Anambra governor. According to the source, “EFCC today, March 17, 2022 picked up ex-governor Obiano of Anambra State. “The former governor who has been on the Commission’s watchlist was arrested at the Murtala Mohammad International Airport Lagos at about 8.30pm as he prepared to board a flight to Houston, USA.” Recall that the EFCC had placed the ex-governor on its watchlist. In a letter to the Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Immigrations Service (NIS) dated November 15, 2021, the commission requested the service to place the governor on a watch list and inform it anytime he is travelling out of the country from any of the international airports and other points of entry and exit. It was not clear why the anti-graft agency placed the governor on security watch but sources said the move was an indication that the agency may have been discreetly investigating Obiano and possibly have intelligence that he planned to escape after handing over power to his successor, Prof Charles Soludo.
