Four suspected bandits terrorising residents of Katsina Ala local government area and environs in Benue State were on Tuesday neutralised by men of the “Operation Whirl Stroke” (OPWS). Following the killing of the four bandits in Tse-Keji camp by the men of OPWS during which their camp was destroyed and charms packed, the leader of the bandits who is identified as Terna is threatening reprisal attack. LEADERSHIP gathered that the troops uncovered a camp where the bandits were hiding to carry out their criminal activities at Tse Keji. A source who does not want his name in print said troops stationed in Gbise in Kastina-Ala council were on normal clearance tour when they came across the bandits’ camp at Tse-Keji and on sighting the troops, the gunmen opened fire but were overpowered by the troops and fled into the bush. The source said, “There was exchange of gunfire but the troops overpowered them and the bandits fled into the bush in disarray but the troops gave them a hot pursuit and four of them were neutralised in the  process.” He also informed that the troops conducted a search in the area and recovered some items belonging to the bandits which included 9 rounds of 7.6mm special, one Dane gun, two motorcycles, handsets, bags of Indian hemps, cash and charms. He said, “Some of the bandits also escaped, however, the troops set their camp ablaze.” When contacted, the chairman of Kastina-Ala LGA Alfred Atera who confirmed the incident said the leader of the bandits who escaped has threatened the residents of the area. Atera said, “Following the killing of four bandits in Tse-Keji camp by the men of OPWS during which their camp was destroyed and charms were packed, the leader of the bandits who is identified as Terna is threatening reprisal. “As of this morning, he called and issued a lot of threats that he is going to do more than what was destroyed in his camp. I learnt he even called one of the volunteer guards’ phone line to issue the same threat.”
