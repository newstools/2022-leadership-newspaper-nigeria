Governor Charles Soludo of Anambra State has ordered all public servants and political office holders in the state to begin reporting to their places of work on Mondays or face sanctions. PREMIUM TIMES learnt that the directive is part of Mr Soludo’s efforts to end the Monday sit-at-home order usually observed in Anambra and other South-east states. The sit-at-home order was introduced by the pro-Biafra group, IPOB, to put pressure on the federal government to release its leader, Nnamdi Kanu who is standing trial in Abuja for alleged treasonable felony and terrorism. Although IPOB had suspended the order,  residents have continued to observe it mostly out of fear of possible attacks by gunmen. Governor Soludo has repeatedly condemned the civil order which has disrupted the local economies.
