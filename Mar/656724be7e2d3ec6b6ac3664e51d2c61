The New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) National Executive Committee (NEC) has dissolved its state and national executives and constituted a caretaker committee to run the affairs of the party for one month. Although it did not announce date, it stated that new officers of the party would be elected during the national convention. The party’s dissolution of the national and state executives may not be unconnected with the desire of the party to reposition and expand its frontiers to accommodate new interests. Earlier the party’s national secretary Mr Agbo Major, had told newsmen that the former governor of Kano State, Engr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso was bringing his entire political structures into the party. Mr Agbo Major, who stated this in an interview in Abuja, Tuesday, before the party’s extraordinary National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, noted that the party was repositioning as a prelude to its national convention. Kwankwaso had last week launched a political group known as the The National Movement (TNM). Prominent Nigerians expected in the TNM are the founder of The National Movement (TNM) and former governor of Kano State, Engr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso and the former national publicity secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prof Rufai Alkali, and Engr Buba Galadima, amongst others. The NNPP national scribe said there was need for the party to adjust to be able to accommodate the interest that were  coming adding that such crucial decisions to be taken at the meeting would midwife the party’s national convention. On any possible merger, alliance or coalition with other political parties, the NNPP national secretary said the party would not venture into that as such electoral alliance in the past did not yield the desired result.
