Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has withdraw from the race for the deputy national chairmanship position of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Dogara stepped down from the race for Senator Abubakar Kyari, who emerged the consensus candidate for the position of Deputy Chairman (North). The former Speaker who announced his decision to step down in a letter dated March 25, addressed to chairman of the APC national convention election/planning sub-committee and Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, said he decided to withdraw from the race following President Muhammadu Buhari’s directives to adopt a consensus candidate in filling party positions at the APC convention. Others gunning for the office are former governor of Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda; Senator Abubakar Girei; Sunny Moniedafe; former Senator Abubakar Kyari and Honourable Faruk Aliyu. Accordingly, he pledged his unalloyed support for the consensus candidate, Senator Kyari for the deputy national chairman (North) position.  Chairman of the convention media sub-committee and Nasarawa State governor, Abdullahi Sule, had stated on Friday that the APC had settled for consensus and nothing more, adding that the unity list was ready. He reiterated that the party prefers candidates contesting national working committee (NWC) positions to emerge through consensus. He however noted that members who feel otherwise about a consensus candidate would be allowed to test their popularity at the polls. He submitted that the consensus option ensures the process is faster and rancour-free. Sule said this would not amount to denying aspirants the opportunity to contest or for delegates to vote as anyone who disagrees with the consensus candidate would be allowed to slug it out at the polls.
