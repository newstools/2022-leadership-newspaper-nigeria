Oil prices jumped by more than $6 on Monday, with Brent crude climbing above $114 a barrel, as European Union nations considered joining the United States in a Russian oil embargo and after a weekend attack on Saudi oil facilities. Brent crude futures were up $6.52, or 6%, at $114.45 a barrel by, adding to a 1.2% rise on Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose $5.90, or 5.6%, to $110.60.

The latest report from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, together known as OPEC+, showed some producers are still falling short of their agreed supply quotas.
