The commissioner for internal security and home affairs, Samuel Aruwan, in a statement said the decision to relax the curfew period from 6pm to 6am was reached after a review of the security situation presented by security agencies at a peace engagement. He said with this development, there will be movement in the areas from 6am to 6pm, while the curfew is to be observed from 6pm to 6am daily.
