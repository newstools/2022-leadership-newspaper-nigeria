Barely 24 hours to the national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), a former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Lasun Yussuf, has resigned his membership of the party. Yussuf was a former gubernatorial aspirant of APC in Osun State in 2018. He also aspired to be the governorship candidate of the party in the party’s 2022 primary election. He submitted his resignation letter on Friday at the party’s state secretariat, along Gbongan Road, Ogo Oluwa, in Osogbo, the state capital. Efforts to get the content of his letter failed as principal officers of the party had left the state capital for the party’s national convention in Abuja. When contacted, the former federal lawmaker, who confirmed his resignation from APC, said he would give reason for his action and disclose his next line of action in due course.
