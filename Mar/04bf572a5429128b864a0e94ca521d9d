A statement from the Nigerians in the Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) said they were well received by top officials of Federal Government at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport at Abuja. According to a source in NIDCOM, most of the evacuees in Friday’s batch were students earlier trapped in the Ukrainian city of Sumy, surrounded by Russian troops. A corridor was created for them to leave the city after a negotiation between the Nigerian government and the Government of Ukraine. Receiving the 123 evacuees, the Head of Technology Transfer Innovative of NIDCOM, Hon. AbdurRahman Terab, said in addition to the $100 given to each returnee, NiDCOM in partnership with MTN gave each of them a free SIM loaded with N5,000 airtime. According to him, once the SIM is activated, the N5,000 airtime multiply to N19,500 worth of airtime. This additional kind gesture was well received and appreciated by all the evacuees.
