A forensic sexual assault examiner, Dr Mistura Shogunle, on Wednesday presented her findings before the Lagos State Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court in the trial of a 20-year-old fashion designer, Rasheed Fashola accused of defiling a 13-year-old girl. Shogunle was called as an expert witness in the trial of Fashola, who is one of the seven-man gangs who allegedly took turns to rape the survivor (name withheld). The defendant was arraigned before Justice Rahmon Oshodi by the Lagos State government on a two-count charge of conspiracy and defilement of a child. The prosecution had claimed that Fashola alongside others who are now at large committed the offence at about 8:pm on September 27, 2020, in an uncompleted building around Oluwashina Junction, Itire, Lagos. The prosecutor, Mrs Olasunbo Abiodun-Muniru, maintained that the offences contravened sections 137 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015. While being led in evidence, by the state prosecutor, the medical doctor working at the Mirabel Centre (a sexual assault referral centre) said that the survivor came seeking medical attention on September 28, 2020, a day after she was allegedly defiled.  She said, “The client said that on Sept. 27, 2020, which was a Sunday, her father sent her on an errand and seven boys in the neighbourhood stopped her.’’  “They dragged her into an uncompleted building, her mouth was covered with a handkerchief and they took turns to rape her through unprotected penile intercourse into her vagina,” Shogunle said. Justice Oshodi  adjourned the matter till May 6, 2022 for the continuation of trial.
