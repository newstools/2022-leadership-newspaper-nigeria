President of the University of Abuja chapter of the Northern Nigerian Students Forum, Malam Abdullahi Usman Chachi, has appealed to the government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to immediately reach an understanding so that students can resume their studies. It would be recalled that the Union embarked on a warning strike on Monday 14th February, 2022 over the federal government’s failure to implement all agreements since 2009. Chachi noted that the incessant strikes had affected the reading ability of students, and led to the production of unqualified graduates in their fields of study. “Dialogue is very important, and at the right time not when things have gone from bad to worse, and the students who are usually at the receiving end of the crisis have been brutally frustrated. “I wish to plead with the Federal Government to come to terms with our lecturers, who cannot give their best because they are not in the right frame of mind. “Our appeal is for the two groups to sit at a table and resolve this crisis immediately. This strike which results in less academic engagement will lead students to some social vices such as cybercrime, armed robbery, cultism, political thuggery, prostitution and extremism,” Chachi said. He noted that education is important now more than any time in the history of the nation, adding that any attempt to deny the youth such a privilege or opportunity would spell doom for Nigeria.
