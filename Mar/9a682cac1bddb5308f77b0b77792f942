The Nigerian entertainment industry, corporate sector, and family of Evangelist Ebenezer Obey-Fabiyi is set to celebrate the legendary musician as he clocks 80 next month on April 3. The celebration will further serve as an avenue to honour the Miliki king for his positive impact on the entertainment industry over the last six decades; spanning moral teachings, cultural promotion and developmental ideologies through his music. According to the birthday celebration committee, the leadership and members of Decross Gospel Mission will host Obey, who is also the General Overseer of the church, his family and dignitaries from all walks of life at a Thanksgiving Service on April 3, at the church headquarters, at Iyanapaja, Agege, Lagos. A grand reception will follow the service on April 8, at the popular Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) event hall, in Abeokuta, Ogun State. In acknowledgement of the unprecedented role of the living legend in the industry, organisers of Headies Awards will host the music icon at a classy event on May 22, at Eko Hotel and Suites, Lagos. The event will feature the convergence of young generation artistes and others to honour the music icon, just as a new biography of Obey will be launched at the event. Obey is arguably the Nigerian musician with the greatest evergreen hits and several songs which are still relevant today.
