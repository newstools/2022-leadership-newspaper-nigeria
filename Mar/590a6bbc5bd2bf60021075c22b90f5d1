A former federal lawmaker and human rights activist, Senator Shehu Sani, has told aspirants for the 2023 presidential election to stop shedding tears wherever they visit for campaigns. Sani, who represented Kaduna Central in the Senate between 2015 and 2019, said such campaign strategy was unnecessary as it can lead to sorrow, suffering, pestilence and affliction for the electorate. The former lawmaker, who took to his verified Twitter handle on Monday, specifically directed his message to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State, Dr. Bukola Saraki, Omoyele Sowore, and other presidential aspirants. Shehu Sani wrote: “Presidential candidates should avoid shedding tears and moving about with white handkerchiefs as a campaign strategy, it leads a nation to pestilence, affliction, sorrow and suffering. “CC: Atiku, Jagaban, Tambuwal, Wike, Osibanjo, Tambuwal, Saraki, Sowore, Momodu, Moghalu, Rotimi, Ugwuanyi, Kwankwaso, Peter Obi, Pius Anyim, Fayemi,Yeriman Bakura etc.”
