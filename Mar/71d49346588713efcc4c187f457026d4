Military sources said the Air Component of Operation Thunder Strike following credible information that at about 2pm on March 30, 2022, about 70 terrorists on 40 motorcycles and some on foot were sighted moving towards the Akilibu – Sarkin Pawa Road, near Mangoro village, scrambled an aircraft to intercept and neutralise the terrorists. He said, “As the aircraft approached the scene, several terrorist were seen running in disarray on sighting the aircraft, abandoning their motorcycles to take cover within nearby bushes. “The terrorists were subsequently engaged in different waves with rockets while those fleeing were mopped up with canons decisively. “Feedback from local sources around Mangoro village disclosed that 17 motorcycles including 34 dead bodies as well as 14 locally fabricated guns belonging to the terrorists were recovered.” The source, however, could not confirm if the said terrorists were responsible for the attack on the Abuja-Kaduna bound train on Monday night. “It is unclear if the terrorists were part of those that attacked and killed 8 passengers days ago onboard a Kaduna bound train,” he said. The locals while commending the military for their improved swiftness to emergencies, also charged them to ensure they apprehend those behind the murder of passengers of the Kaduna bound train. When contacted, the Director of Public Relations and Information, Nigeria Air Force, Air Cdre Edward Gabkwet, confirmed that NAF aircraft were carrying out series of interdictions in the region and recording great successes.
