House of Representatives has urged the federal government and the relevant agencies to construct a 33/11 KVA injection Sub-station at Igbo-Ora in Ibarapa Central local government area and a 33/11 KVA injection Sub-station at Igangan, all in Ibarapa axis of Oyo State. The House mandated its Committees on Appropriation, Finance and Power to include the construction of 33/11kva injection Sub-Station at Igbo-Ora, in Ibarapa Central local government and 33/11 KV A injection Sub-station at Igangan in Ibarapa North local government of Oyo State in the 2023 Budget estimates. It also mandated the Committees on Appropriation, Finance, Power and Legislative Compliance to liaise with the Budget Office of the Federation, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Power to ensure compliance. These followed the adoption of a motion on the Need to Construct 33/11KVA Injection Sub-station at Igbo-Ora in Ibarapa Central local government area and 33/11KVA Injection Sub-station at Igangan in Ibarapa North local government area of Oyo State moved by Hon Muraina. S. Ajibola, who represents Ibarapa Central/ Ibarapa North Federal Constituency of Oyo State. The House noted that Ibarapa council is a semi-urban area which serves as the food basket of Oyo State. The House also noted that in 2005, the federal government adopted the rural electrification policy with the aim of increasing electricity to 90 percent for rural areas in Nigeria by 2030. It further noted that the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company was responsible for the supply and distribution of electricity to Ibarapa in Oyo State. The House said access to electricity facilitates sustainable economy and social growth in rural or semi-urban areas and was concerned that the electricity supply in the entire Ibarapa land has been epileptic due to poor electrical installations, prompting the people to migrate to the city as a result of the consequent decline in socioeconomic activities and access to basic facilities.
