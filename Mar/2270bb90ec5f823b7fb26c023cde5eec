The approval came barely 24 hours after the inauguration of the new terminal building at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos. Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, disclosed this to State House Correspondents after the week’s federal executive council (FEC )meeting, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. According to him, the entire sum would be spread over several works to be carried out at the airport, and the project is expected to be delivered in 12 months. Recall that President Buhari, while inaugurating the new terminal building at the MMAI in Lagos on Tuesday, had instructed the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, to source funding for the second runway project for the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja. However, asked how government hopes to raise funding for the project on Wednesday, Sirika said the administration would use same pattern it had used to raise funding for all of its other projects across sectors to achieve the new task.
