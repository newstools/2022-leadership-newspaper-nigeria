However, secretary of the national caretaker committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, denied any change of leadership in the party, describing it as fake news. He stated in a statement: “Our attention has been drawn to sponsored media reports on an imaginary leadership change in the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).” “The media report is fake news and should be disregarded.
