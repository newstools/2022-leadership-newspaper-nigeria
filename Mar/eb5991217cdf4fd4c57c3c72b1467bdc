Senate President Ahmad Lawan has said the success recorded by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) during its National Convention over the weekend, was a huge disappointment for naysayers who expected the party to fail. This was just as he stated that lawmakers belonging to the opposition party in the upper chamber have better prospects by becoming members of the APC. Lawan made this known in his remarks while congratulating Senators Abdullahi Adamu and Abubakar Kyari, respectively, on their emergence as national chairman and deputy national chairman (North) of the All Progressives Congress (APC). In his congratulatory remarks, Lawan said, “Senator Abdullahi Adamu, was elected as the new national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for four years. “Another distinguished member of this Senate, Senator Abubakar Kyari representing Borno North was also elected as the deputy national chairman (North) of the APC. “These two distinguished senators are now in charge of our party in Nigeria and beyond. It is a very good development for the legislature, the National Assembly and, particularly, the Senate, because these are our exports. “On behalf of us all in this Senate, I want to congratulate our colleagues, the new chairman and deputy chairman of the APC. “We wish them God’s guidance and protection as they steer the ship of the new APC.” Speaking on the success of the just concluded national convention of the party, he said, “it was a night of unity for the APC members, supporters, lovers and friends. “But, of course, it was a night of disappointment for those who felt the APC will never conduct a convention, and a successful one at that.”
