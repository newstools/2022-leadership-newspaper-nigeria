According information gathered, the bandits invaded the area around 9.00pm on Wednesday night, shooting sporadically before abducting the victims. LEADERSHIP reports that this is the second time bandits would invade Kofar Gayan Low-cost and abduct innocent residents. Sometime last year, the bandits invaded the neighborhood and abducted the wife of another Customs officer and a woman who got released after N15million was reportedly paid as ransom. Confirming the latest attack, the Ward Head of the area, Muhammadu Nazifi, told journalists that: “those kidnapped include Jamalu, Muawiyya Gambo Turaki, a Customs officer, who arrived home from his duty post just yesterday and his son, Khalifa.” He added, “They also kidnapped a woman, Jamila Usman and another boy also called Khalifah. However, about four of them later escaped and returned home.” Also speaking, one of the victims who escaped, Yushau Isah, said about four of them managed to escape after trekking with the bandits for about five kilometers into the bush. According to him, “The abductors were eight in numbers and came on foot with sophisticated weapons. They struggled to speak Hausa language to us but their language of communication is different from Hausa. “We managed to escape under the cover of the night, we attribute the abduction to the handiwork of informants because it seems their main target was the Customs officer, who arrived home from his duty post, just a day earlier.” Meanwhile, the Kaduna State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Muhammed Jalige, could not be reached on his mobile phone as at the time of this report.
