A frontline group of youths and women loyal to the Peoples Democratic People (PDP), the PDP New Generation, has expressed concern about the recent infightings in the biggest opposition party, calling on party leaders to sheath their swords and galvanise support for the 2023 general election. In an interview with the director-general of the group, Mr. Audu Mahmood, he said: “As new generation politicians, who are learning the art of politics from our leaders and party chieftains, we have come to the conclusion that we have to weigh in and call all relevant stakeholders of the party to settle all the fracas and further position the PDP for takeover in 2023. “As it stands today, no other political party can rescue Nigeria at this moment from the confused and unstable ruling party, APC. A leader sees things through the eyes of his followers. They put themselves in their shoes and help them make their dreams come true. The dream and mission of the PDP New Generation is to have the PDP back to its winning ways and good leadership in 2023.” “We are, therefore, using this opportunity as a group to call for peace and harmony in PDP, this is the time to stand together and work collectively to chase APC to the dustbin of history. “The PDP New Generation with membership of thousands of youths and women will work extensively with the party to deliver Nigerians in 2023.” According to the DG, he pointed out that Nigeria was in a state of disarray, citing insurgency, banditry, youth unemployment, ASUU strike, fuel scarcity, claiming that country was in need of the PDP to make it great again.
