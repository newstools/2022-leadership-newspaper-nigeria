MultiChoice Nigeria has increased the prices of its DStv and GOtv packages, blaming the decision on rising cost of operations. MultiChoice Nigeria is the Nigerian subsidiary company of MultiChoice Africa, owner of DStv and GOtv. “In light of the rising costs of inflation and business operations, we have had to review the price of our packages to keep delighting our customers with great entertainment, anytime and anywhere,” the statement said. Therefore, from April 1, 2022, a new pricing regime for both our DStv and GOtv packages will be in effect.” New DStv rates are: Premium (N21,000), Compact + (N14,250), Compact (N9,000), Confam (N5,300), Yanga (N2,950), Padi (N2,150), Business (N2,669), Xtraview + PVR access fee (N2,900) Those of GOtv as follows: Gotv Max for N4,150, GOtv Jolli for N2,800, GOtv Jinja for N1,900, GOtv Lite for N900. Multichoice said customers who subscribe on or before April 1 would be eligible to pay the old price. Additionally, subscribers that pay consistently (before their due dates) for a period of 12 months would enjoy the old price. “Customers who pay for 10 months upfront on the new price will get the 11th and 12th month free,” the statement added.
