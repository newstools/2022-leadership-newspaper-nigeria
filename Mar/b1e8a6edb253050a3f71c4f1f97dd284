Sequel to the outburst that greeted the announcement of a murder suspect, Chidinma Ojukwu, as Miss Cell 2022 at the beauty pageant conducted in the female section of Nigerian Correctional Service, Kirikiri, Lagos recently, the national headquarters of the service has explained that psychosocial engagement of inmates had traditionally been part of the service’s’ treatment regimes designed to provide emotional stability, promote total well-being and enhance safe custody. The service in a statement by its national spokesman, Francis Enobore, said prior to the beauty pageant which saw Chidinma’s emergence, several celebrities and internationally recognised artistes such as Sam Okposu, Onyeka Owenu, Pasuma, Denrele, Lamboginny had carried out lavish concerts in male custodial centres in Kirikiri and Ikoyi to celebrate with inmates, irrespective of their status. Enobore said in year 2000, Channels Television covered a musical concert for male inmates at the Ikoyi Custodial Centre where Dr. Sola Fosude, the head of department, Arts & Music, Lagos State University, praised the performance of the inmates and commended the personnel for their efforts, saying the intendment was never to glamourise or make a hero out of criminality. LEADERSHIP Weekend gathered that the controller of the Kirikiri facility under whose watch the event took place, Mrs Lizzie Ekpendu, has been redeployed. Observers are of the view that the redeployment is a last minute damage control strategy by the service following the  heated arguments that the pageant was inappropriate for a suspect facing murder trial. LEADERSHIP Weekend also gathered that Ekpendu, the wife of a former controller -general of prisons, was shifted to the Lagos Command Headquarters, Alagbon, Ikoyi.
