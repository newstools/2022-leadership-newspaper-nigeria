Substance abuse particularly alcohol consumption has been on the rise in Africa for years, according to the World Health Organization. The coronavirus pandemic that resulted in job losses and school closures has now amplified the problem. The Ikageng children’s charity in Soweto, South Africa said as many as 10 young people contact them daily suffering from addiction. Lydia Motloung, the acting program manager said that “during the lockdowns, they used to go and drink and some they were left in the houses alone, the parents are at work. And they start having the house parties and introduced to the alcohol, end up into crystal meth, which is very common around here, especially with schoolchildren.” While Ikageng monitors the rise of addiction in the young people they’re helping, Motloung said national statistics on drug and alcohol abuse are sorely lacking. “We normally get the statistics for COVID-19, you get the statistics for HIV, but we will never had any statistics for drugs and substance. I think if we can have that plan, the government can have that plan. … And then start funding the organization that are working with drugs and substance so that they fight it as they’re fighting for HIV and AIDS as they’re fighting for COVID,” she noted. It’s not just South Africa that is lacking data on substance abuse, but the continent as a whole. Florence Baingana is the African regional advisor on substance abuse for the World Health Organization. “We may not count the exact numbers in each and every country. We know we have a problem. We also know that the services are inadequate, that one we know for a fact. Very often the alcohol treatment centers in the government facilities are underfunded. But I think if we were to begin by investing resources into building up the services, then we would be able to collect the data,” Baingana expressed.
