The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Caucus in the House of Representatives, has called on the Ebonyi State governor, David Umahi, to immediately withdraw the charges filed against the party’s spokesman in the state, Mr Nwoba Chika Nwoba. The caucus also vowed to resist what it described as nanny dictatorship in the state, thereby urging the Nigerian Police Force to discharge its duties diligently without doing the bidding of anyone, no matter how highly placed in government. Leader of the caucus, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, in a statement noted that Nwoba did not commit any offence known to the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic (as amended). Chinda said it was no surprise, therefore, that the Magistrate Court rightly declined jurisdiction to entertain the trumped-up charges filed before it but choose to detain the accused while rejecting the charge. According to him, Nigeria’s fledgling democracy was founded on respect for the rule of law, not the paired fists of any governor. “As a Caucus, where we do not witness any improvement in the democratic practices in Ebonyi State within a reasonable time, we deploy all legislative measures available to us both locally and internationally to safeguard the rights of our party members in Ebonyi State and ensure the enthronement of rule of law. “The Nanny Dictator is still in doubt, let’s make it abundantly clear to him that we shall, as a party, continue to resist whatever shenanigans he throws at our members, including challenging his nanny acts and actions in the court of law. What we won’t do is to go low like him and plumb the depth of dirt, while gnawing at the dust of infamy. “We, therefore, call on the Nigeria Police Force to stop doing the bidding of the Nanny Dictator of Ebonyi State and to immediately withdraw the charges filed against Mr.Nwoba Chika Nwoba,” the PDP Caucus stated. LEADERSHIP reports that Nwoba was arrested in September 2021 allegedly at the instigation of Governor Umahi.
