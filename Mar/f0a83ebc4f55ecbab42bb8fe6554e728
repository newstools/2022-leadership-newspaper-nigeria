Federal government has hinted that the Second Niger Bridge linking Anambra and Delta states, is now 91 per cent completed. Minister of works and housing, Babatunde Fashola, made this announcement yesterday during the special weekly ministerial briefing at the State House in Abuja. According to him, the N206 billion project has directly employed 1,486 people while 8,110 indirect jobs have equally been created. The minister pegged major projects under the Presidential Infrastructure Development fund including the 375km Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway estimated at 797 billion naira; the 11.59km Second Niger Bridge at N206 billion  and the 127km Lagos-Ibadan Expressway at 310 billion naira, at N1.3 trillion. He said, “The Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and Second Niger Bridge will be completed by the end of the year while the main Carriageway of Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway is scheduled for completion by the second quarter of 2023. “The Second Niger Bridge was first proposed during the 1978/79 political campaign by then-candidate Shehu Shagari of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN).” However, in August 2012, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) under then-President Goodluck Jonathan approved a contract worth N325 million for the final planning and design of the bridge. A somewhat complicated procedure continued under President Muhammad Buhari, who first cancelled the earlier contract in August 2015.
