Billionaire Russian businessman, Roman Abramovich, has confirmed he will sell off Chelsea Football Club, with all net proceeds from the sale to be donated to victims of the war in Ukraine. Earlier this week, Labour MP, Chris Bryant, used Parliamentary Privilege to also reveal Abramovich is selling his UK home and another flat, telling the House of Commons the Russian billionaire is “terrified of being sanctioned.” He earlier handed “stewardship and care” of Chelsea to the club Foundation’s trustees on Saturday, in a move aimed to protect the Stamford Bridge club following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Chelsea owner has now publicly admitted he is looking to sell the club, with Swiss billionaire, Hansjorg Wyss, claiming he has been offered the chance to buy the club. Abramovich is owed £1.5billion by Chelsea after buying the club in a £140m deal in 2003, but says he will not ask for any of the loans to be repaid.
