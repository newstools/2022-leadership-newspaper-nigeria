BY HENRY TYOHEMBA, Abuja The University of Abuja is seeking partnership with National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) for the establishment of a Centre for Reverse Engineering and Innovation on campus to provide the much desired university-industry linkages and revolutionise industrial development of Nigeria. The Vice – Chancellor, Professor Abdul-Rasheed Na’Allah, made the proposal when he led some senior members of the Faculty of Engineering on a courtesy visit to the Executive Vice- Chairman/Chief Executive of NASENI, Professor Mohammed Sani Haruna, on Tuesday first 1 February 2022. Na’Allah, who assured the agency that the University was committed to strengthening research for improvement of the nation’s local industries and employment generation, added that it was open to collaborations especially in research laboratories. Na’Allah said, “Renewal of the MOU is imperative for the attainment of great goals for the nation. A lot of things that must be achieved in this nation would be neglected if we do not renew this MOU. The University is constantly thinking about the next strategy to resolve the next problem and assist this nation in every aspect of development. “I want to thank you for extending the hand of collaboration to us, we are eager to bring our students and scholars to work with you to get this done for this nation.” In his response, Professor M.S Haruna, said the objectives and competencies of the proposed Centre were within the mandate of NASENI even as he assured the University of the agency’s full participation. “I am glad you now have specifics you want to achieve with us. We will look at the proposal, in fact, we love this proposal already, it is in line with our mandate and we will participate fully in it,” the chief executive said.
