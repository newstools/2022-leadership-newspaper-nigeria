Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has ordered security agencies in the state to uncover those behind the recent burning of churches in Kwale, Ndokwa West local government area of the state. Some unknown persons on March 16  and March 17, 2022 set ablaze the Assemblies of God Church, Celebration Centre, Ogbe Atuma Branch and Light of God and Wisdom Ministry all in Kwale. The governor, who was represented by his special adviser on religious matters, Snr. Apostle Sylvanus Okorote, gave the order when he visited the scenes of the churches burnt in Kwale. He urged security agencies to investigate and unravel the perpetrators of the acts as they are not spirits. While expressing sympathy with the affected churches, the governor assured them of thorough investigation to fish out those behind the crime. The CAN coordinator, Ndokwa West, Rev. Anthony Adinike, said a petition had earlier been written to the divisional police officer in Kwale on the incessant burning of churches. The special adviser also met with the Oduosa of Utagba-Ogbe Kingdom, HRM. Nzeuku Isaac Pius Obi, who assured him that he and his council of chiefs would do their best to see that the incident does not reoccur. Between year 2020 and 2021, about seven churches were burnt in the area.
