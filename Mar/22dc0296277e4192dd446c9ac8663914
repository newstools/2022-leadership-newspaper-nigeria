A former governor of Imo State and incumbent Senator representing Imo West in the National Assembly, Rochas Okorocha, has expressed willingness to join the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in the 2023 presidential race as his running mate. Okorocha said if the possibility of a Tinubu and Rocha’s ticket emerged ahead of the 2023 presidential election, he would clinch it. He expressed confidence in the possibility of the duo winning the election, stating that he was loved by people because he has sympathy for humanity and shuns tribalism. He stated this while addressing journalists at the just-concluded APC National Convention in Abuja on Saturday. He said, “Uncle Tinubu and I are most likely to be. I know that at the appropriate time it may be, because he is the one pushing up in the South-West and I am in the South-East. “So let us see what happens between us, and if that is it, I will ask him to relax a bit so that we can move this section forward. “The people naturally love me and I think it is because they believe I care, they believe I love and have sympathy for humanity, they believe I am detribalised. “They believe I do not know religion or tribe, Muslim, Christian, Igbo or Hausa, Yoruba, all I see is a human being and that is what makes the difference on my side.”
