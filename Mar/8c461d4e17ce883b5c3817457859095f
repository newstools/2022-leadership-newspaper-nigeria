Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, has declared that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was determined to end the economic hardship foisted on Nigerians by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led federal government. He however enjoined Nigerians to demonstrate that they were truly tired of the bad leadership style of the APC and to be willing to use their Voter’s Card to vote the ruling party out of office in 2023. Wike spoke yesterday at the inauguration of the 3.5 km long Mgbuoshimini-Nkpor Road in Rumuolumeni Community,  Obio/Akpor local government area of the state. The governor stated that the APC gropes in failure because it does not have in its kitty the quality of productive good governance. He said: “If this crowd that has come out here will come out in 2023, the election will be free. If you don’t change the bad government, you too, you are part of the bad government. “So, use your Voter’s Card to throw away this government at the federal level that has killed Nigeria. That has  made hunger, and poverty everywhere. People don’t have jobs, hard economy policy that does not work. But by the grace of God, PDP will change all these.” Wike noted that since the APC cannot give what it does not have, PDP was gearing up to steer a national revolution in infrastructure delivery and it will begin from 2023. The governor assured that the leadership that will be seen then will not give excuses, but be committed to growing the economy of the country and restore hope and meaningful living. He said: “It is only in PDP States that you can see commissioning of projects. While the other (APC) governors are meeting their president on whether convention will hold or not, we are doing projects upon projects. “So, that is what Nigeria will witness when PDP takes over in 2023. It will be a revolution in infrastructure. There will be no excuses at all. APC government has nothing to offer. It is said that you cannot give what you don’t have.”
