A political group in the All Progressives Congress, (APC), under the auspices of Credible Alliance for Better Nigeria (CABN) has called on all aspirants contesting for positions during the APC convention to adhere to rules and regulations of the party for the party to get it right during the convention. The group who are advocating that the party should stand by its zoning arrangement expressed confidence that it is the only way that the right leaders would be elected into the right positions, without any selfish politician hijacking the process. National coordinator of the group, Dr. Ahmed Badanga, who made this known in a press conference yesterday, said the group aligned its position with President Muhammadu Buhari and that the actions of the leaders of the party pose a real threat to the party. He cautioned some leaders in the party against sabotaging the party’s decision on the adoption of zoning arrangements of executive offices in the forthcoming convention slated for March 26. He said the group cannot continue folding its arms in the face of what he called a huge threat to the party because of the ambition of a few party leaders. Badanga said the party leaders have chosen to ignore President Buhari’s concern and directive in a recent letter he addressed to the chairman of Progressive Governors Forum, Governor Atiku Bagudu. “As major stakeholders in the APC, we want to urge all leaders and their followers within the party to respect the adopted zoning arrangement and respect party supremacy. Party leaders and governors should lead by example. “We are appealing to the Convention Planning Committee, especially the Screening Committee and the Screening Appeals Committee, to have the courage to do the right thing by disqualifying any aspirant that applies for a position that’s not zoned to his region of origin, ” he added.
