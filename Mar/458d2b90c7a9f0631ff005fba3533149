Stakeholders from Kogi State have expressed concerns on the need to upgrade the Human Community Center in Adavi/Okehi federal constituency to a Teaching Hospital rather than converting the Federal Medical Center (FMC) in Lokoja to a teaching hospital. The stakeholders made the call during a public hearing organised by the House of Representatives Committee on Health Institutions on 10 Bills geared towards establishing new tertiary health institutions in various parts of the country. Engr. Asuku Joseph, who represented Adavi/Okehi federal constituency of the state in the House, said it will be unfair to concentrate all establishments at Lokoja, which already has a university presence. He said development should rather be expanded to other areas like Adavi/Okehi federal constituency of Kogi State since it has the landmass, human capacity and infrastructure, while the human community center is well equipped. According to him, “this has nothing to do with politics. This is the yearning of the people. People that have neglected for so long. Since the creation of Kogi state, this institution (Centre) has been neglected and this is not to cast aspersions on Kwara State or University of Ilorin, no, but we have to state the fact. “Out of sight is out of mind. What we want is this, we want it to take its rightful position to be in Kogi State, so that we can have the ownership. This center is already equipped with the manpower, infrastructure and landmass. So, it will be a seamless transition to upgrade it rather than concentrate everything always in the center.”
