A leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State and frontline aspirant for Ado Odo Ota Federal House of Representatives Engr. Musibau Alade jimoh has said Governor Dapo Abiodun should be rewarded with a second term in office as the state’s helmsman for harnessing both the human and capital resources of the state to serve the greater interest of the populace. Alade, who is eyeing the seat of Ado Odo Ota federal constituency in 2023 stated this at a forum organised by Progressive Friends, adding that the Governor Abiodun is dedicated and committed to leaving the state better than he met it. “It is so obvious that Governor Abiodun deserves our commendation and support, given his performance in critical sectors like education, health, road construction, housing, agriculture among others. The governor has ensured that every part of Ogun State is witnessing exponential development. So, for a governor that has shown this great capacity in leadership, it is just proper we allow him to continue his good works beyond 2023, after all, you don’t disband a winning team,” he said. “I am particularly happy that some of our roads in and around Ogun State that have been given us so much concern are receiving due attention from the governor. Roads like Attan -Losada- Agbara road, Ado-Odo/Ikoga  road, Molipa express road, the newly commissioned  Ijebu Ode-Epe road with flyover, Folagbade road, the abandoned Imowo Eleran among others.” Alade said given the important role youths play in politics, he was poised to rally more youths across the state to continue to support the good government of the governor and to team up with other members of the ruling party for the governor’s second term bid.
