It was gathered that the peace meeting of Yoruba leaders over reconciliation between Asiwaju Tinubu and Ogbeni Aregbesola was held at a private residence of the Alaafin of Oyo in Ibadan and it lasted about two hours. The primary objective of the monarchs was to resolve the minister’s rift with his benefactor. The meeting, it was gathered, became necessary  following Aregbesola’s outburst against Tinubu and Gboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun State, during the build-up to February 2022 primary election of the APC in the state. It was also learnt that the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, NSCIA, had also waded into the matter. Source said it was Aregbesola who asked the two prominent monarchs to resolve his feud with Tinubu, who is eyeing the presidential ticket of the APC in the 2023 election. The meeting had in attendance the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi; the  Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi and Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola as a first step towards finding a lasting reconciliation between the two. After consultations, the leaders agreed to move to the next stage of the meeting which will be held at a later date
