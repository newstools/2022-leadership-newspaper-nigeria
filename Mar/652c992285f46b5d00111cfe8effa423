Ohuabunwa, who is also the Convener of the New Nigeria Group (NNG) frowned at the arson on the elder stateman’s country home. He further described the the arson as a “desecration of the Igbo ethos” and expressed sadness that such as distardly act could be visited on the “symbol of Igbo collective and authority”. The presidential Aspirant therefore urged the government to leave no stone unturned in fishing out those responsible for the heinous act. Ohuabunwa also called on all well meaning sons and daughters of South East to join hands in halting the violence currently being witnessed in the region. He noted that violence has never solved any problem and urged all aggrieved youths to embrace dialogue. Ohuabunwa promised to tackle the growing insecurity in the land of the opportunity to pilot the affairs of Nigeria come 2023.
