The Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has entered into a training partnership with the governments of the United States and France on counter terrorism, counter insurgency and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear explosives. The commandant -general of the corps, Dr Ahmed Abubakar Audi, has also given approval for a robust collaboration with the US and France in other different areas of training and manpower development. The partnership was the outcome of visits by a delegation from the U.S and France to the NSCDC. The delegation expressed readiness to enhance the capacity of the NSCDC personnel through different categories of training for effective performance in different areas of its mandates. A statement by DCC Olusola Odumosu, the director, public relations at the NSCDC national headquarters quoted the NSCDC boss as saying that the partnership positions the NSCDC to better perform better its statutory responsibilities including the protection of critical national assets and infrastructure, disaster and crisis management, regulation of private guards companies and other given ad-hoc assignments such as the agro rangers, counter insurgency operations among others. He said protection of critical national assets and infrastructure from vandals would be better done when the corps is equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance equipment like surveillance cameras, utility vehicles to navigate difficult terrains, drones and tracking devices; saying such assistance will help the corps to carry out diligent prosecution of its assignments. Audi emphasised that training would better reposition the NSCDC to respond more proportionately to the current asymmetric warfare affecting Nigeria. The senior regional security officer at the US Embassy, Michael Vannett Steven, appreciated the corps for its response to security situations in the country, citing the peaceful conduct of its personnel in different national assignments in Abuja and across the country. Steven expressed willingness to support and collaborate with NSCDC, saying his country had enough expertise in many areas and advised Audi to articulate the corps’ areas of needs accordingly in order of priority, assuring that the US would leverage on the existing relationship to assist the corps in succeeding.
