A popular Nigeria actress, Chioma Topilis, has been remanded at the Nigeria Correctional Centre, Afara, Abia State for alleged cybercrime on the order of a Magistrate Court, sitting in Umuahia, the state capital. Chioma is alleged to have posted in her Facebook a malicious article against the chairman of the state Traditional Prime Ministers Council, High Chief Uche Akwukwuegbu, in which he termed him as “a rapist and ritualist.” The charge sheet, signed by S. E. Onyemauche, a chief superintendent of police, sighted by LEADERSHIP said the offence is punishable under Section 24(b)of the Cybercrime (Prohibition, Prevention etc) Act, 2015, as applicable in the state. “You equally called him a ritualist who used his last daughter as the sacrificial lamb of the family, hence she is perpetually sick and hidden in the house. A publication you know to be false and intended to cause annoyance among others to Akwukwaegbu.” After reading the charge, there was no plea for bail by the suspect. The trial chief magistrate, His Honour, Idika Kalu, therefore adjourned the matter marked 124c/2022 to April 14. Speaking to LEADERSHIP after the adjournment, Akwukwaegbu, generally known as Bawas, identified the accused as his sister in-law, expressing grief that she resorted to blackmailing him “for who knows what.” The entrepreneur, who claimed innocence of all the allegations, added that he was still at a loss why she resorted to cheap blackmail, insisting that she has to substantiate her claims. The chairman further said the suspect had boasted publicly that “she is highly connected and untouchable after rubbishing me on her Facebook page but she has to prove it at the court.”
