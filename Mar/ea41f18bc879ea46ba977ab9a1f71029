The Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia has  adjourned to April 27 for continuation of hearing of the N25bn suit filed by the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kalu, against the federal government and two others. Kanu, through his special counsel, Aloy Ejimakor, had approached the court presided over by Justice Evelyn to enforce his fundamental rights against unlawful expulsion among three other orders and four declarations. The case was adjourned following the absence of the federal government, President Muhammadu Buhari and the attorney general of the federation and minister of justice, Mr Abubakar Malami, the first, second and third respondents respectively. Speaking to newsmen later, Ejimakor, leading Ohaeto Uwazie, Esq expressed surprise that neither the respondents nor their representatives were present even after they had been duly served with the notice seven days ago. He said: “The suit is sui generis and primarily aimed at redressing the infamous unlawful expulsion or extraordinary rendition of Nnamdi Kanu, which is a clear violation of his fundamental rights.” Explaining that the action was in breach of Article 12(4) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, he added that in addition, he was asking the court to redress the myriad violations that came with the rendition.” Ejimakor, who is also counsel to IPOB, further  noted that on January 19,  2022, a High Court of Abia State sitting in Umuahia, determined that portion of violation of his client’s fundamental rights that occurred in 2017.
