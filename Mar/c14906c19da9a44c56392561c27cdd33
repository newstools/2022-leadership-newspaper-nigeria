The Cycling Federation of Nigeria (CFN) has called for corporate support to stage the 2022 Track Africa Cycling Championships slated for June at the Velodrome of the Moshood Abiola National stadium, Abuja. The CFN technical director, Muhammed Basir, made the plea in an exclusive chat with LEADERSHIP Sports recently. Nigeria was awarded the hosting of the Track Africa Cycling Championships last year when the president of Confederations of African Cycling (CAC), Mohammed Azzam, who doubles as the Vice President of Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), alongside the President of UCI – David Lappartient – signed the contract approving Nigeria as the host. Bashir said awarding the hosting right to Nigeria was in recognition of the federation’s commitment to the development of cycling, adding that the championship would be of immense benefit to Nigeria. According to Bashir, hosting the Track Africa Cycling Championships at the Moshood Abiola National stadium Abuja’s Velodrome will strategically position the facility to secure UCI’s grade as a satellite center for the West African region. “We have a good facility that is one of the best in Africa and we are hoping UCI will make this place a satellite center so that other West African countries can benefit from it. “If it is made a satellite center there will be job opportunities for Nigerians. Everything in the facility is functional but we need to use it on a regular basis, organised competition. I’m using this opportunity to call on corporate bodies to support the Federation to organise events. “We are hosting Track Africa Cycling Championships in June and it is a good opportunity for Nigerians and corporate bodies to start identifying with cycling. We have the talents in Nigeria,” Bashir said. Nigeria was in 2019 given the opportunity to host the championships for the first time.
