Altine laughed as we handed over our passports to the security personnel before being let through. “ You’re so disciplined Maimuna, you need to chill a little. We are on vacay, yay.” I didn’t want to chill, if she had handed him a thousand naira, I would have said nothing, but five? Wouldn’t that corrupt his work ethics? The next customer he had he would be expecting much as well, and who knows maybe soon they would start charging for trolleys instead of letting them out for free like in most airports. We went through immigration and at the biometric check point Altine’s passport would not swipe. She went through for the second time when the immigration officer already exhausted looked at the biometric page and at her sternly as if to make sure her face was what was on the photo in the passport. He handed it back to a confused Altine. I had to chip in, “Sir, what happened?” The man frowned and gestured with a shrug to say, “Nothing, sometimes it does that,” he said referring to the machine.
