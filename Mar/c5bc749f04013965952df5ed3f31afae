Justice Taiwo Taiwo of a Federal High Court in Abuja, has fixed March 25, 2022 to deliver judgment in a suit filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) against Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River. The PDP had dragged the governor to court seeking an order directing him and his deputy, Prof. Ivara Esu, to vacate their offices over their defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC) from PDP. The governor and his deputy were elected on the platform of the PDP in 2015 and 2019 respectively, but defected to the APC on May 20, 2021. Earlier on Monday, Justice Taiwo sacked 20 lawmakers from Cross River State who defected alongside the governor to the APC. In the suit filed by the PDP, the party is praying the court for “a declaration that in view of the provisions of Section 221 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and the democratic system of governance operated in Nigeria, votes at the elections are won by political parties and not their candidate or the candidates sponsored at the election by the political parties.”
