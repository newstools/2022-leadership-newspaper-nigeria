The Lagos State government has arraigned the branch manager of a commercial bank Tope Munis before the state high court in Ikeja for his alleged involvement in a N1.2 billion fraud. Munis, who is the branch manager of the bank in Ikeja GRA, was docked alongside Dare Osamo and Ayoola Bisola on a 15-court amendment charge of conspiracy and fraud before Justice Oyindamola Ogala. The state had earlier docked Osamo and Bisola before the court on the same charge before Munis was arrested and subsequently arraigned on Wednesday. The Director of the Lagos State Department of Public Prosecution (DPP) Dr Jide Martins, during the proceedings, informed the court that the state had amended the charge to include the name of the embattled branch manager. Martins alleged that he connived with Osamo to defraud Star Orient Limited, owned by a businessman, Otunba Babatunde Akanbi Babalola of N1.2 billion. The state claimed in the charge that Tope Munis on February 15, 2016, while acting as branch manager of the bank  located at 48, Isaac John Street, Government Reserve Area (G RA) branch allegedly committed the offence. The prosecution further stated that Munis and Osamo allegedly demonstrate an intention to defraud and without lawful authority or excuses approved the opening of a new account for Star Orient Nigeria Limited when there was no SCUML (i.e Special Control Unit against Money Laundering) number on the account opening form.
