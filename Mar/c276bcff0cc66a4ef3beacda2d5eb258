Bayern Munich have signed 13-year-old starlet Mike Wisdom, paying a staggering €300,000 to snap him up. According to Sky Sport Germany, the Bavarians have been scouting the youngster for around a year-and-a-half. Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund were also said to be serious admirers of Wisdom, with the latter reportedly tabling a “very big offer”. Borussia Monchengladbach, who Wisdom has played for in the Under-14 set-up, were powerless to keeping him at the club and Bayern have won the race for his signature with a six-figure fee. The overall cost will come to €300,000, made up predominantly of a hefty signing on bonus. The player’s parents will also receive a substantial fee for relocation, there will be a junior salary of sorts and Gladbach will be paid €20,000. Players in the Under 15’s and below at Bayern Munich, are said to earn €400 or less but once they get to Under 16’s, the leading players could be coming out with €2,000 and €3,000 per month. Wisdom, who turns 14 on September 24, will join up with the Under 15’s in the summer. The striker is known to be incredibly adept with both feet and impressive in one-on-one situations.
