The Super Eagles of Nigeria, on Friday night, played out a goaless draw against the Black Stars of Ghana in the first leg of the Qatar 2022 World Cup Qualifying play-off encounter at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi. The Super Eagles, who were heavily favoured to win the match, were held by the Ghanaian side, who kept it tight at the back to prevent the Nigerian attackers from having a clear chance at scoring. The result means both teams have everything to play for when Nigeria hosts Ghana in the return leg at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja on Tuesday, March 29, 2022. The eventual winner will qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar later in the year.
