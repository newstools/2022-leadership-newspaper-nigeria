Igboho was released yesterday to the leader of the umbrella body of Yoruba Self-determination Groups, Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide, Professor Banji Akintoye and a French language expert/deputy Alana of Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide, Professor Wale Adeniran. The group’s communications secretary, Mr Maxwell Adeleye, in a statement he issued quoted Akintoye as describing Igboho’s release as a triumph of truth over darkness in Yoruba land. The Department of State Services (DSS) had raided Igboho’s Ibadan residence on July 1, 2021, killed two of his aides and arrested 12 others who were later released after months in detention at the secret police’s headquarters in Abuja. Igboho was declared wanted by the DSS for allegedly stockpiling arms to destabilise Nigeria, an allegation he denied. He escaped to the neighbouring francophone country in July 2021. However, luck ran out on him as he was arrested by the Interpol at a Benin airport on July 19, 2021, when he tried to board a Germany-bound flight. He was remanded in a prison in Benin Republic since then where he was said to have faced trial for immigration-related offences, amongst others. Akintoye, who had earlier said he relocated to Benin Republic to secure Igboho’s freedom, announced yesterday that the activist had been freed. Meanwhile, the Yoruba Youth Socio-cultural Association (YYSA) has commended Akintoye for standing firmly with Igboho and securing his release from Benin Republic detention. The association implored all Yoruba nation agitators to take a break and unanimously support Yoruba leader. Its national president, Olalekan Hammed, said Akintoye deserved an accolade, adding that he stood firmly with Ighoho and ensured his release from Benin prison. He said, ‘’Akintoye is a true Yoruba freedom fighter who sticks to what he believes. We are confident that Nigeria as a nation will be better managed by an experienced Yoruba man if given the chance.”
