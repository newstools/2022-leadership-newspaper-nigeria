Bello during a press conference on Tuesday in Abuja said Nigeria will continue to depreciate and degenerate on the global progress chart if it keeps on procrastinating on automation and digitalisation of processes within the bureaucracy and services sector. “My entry into the race presents Nigerians a chance to relish the finest traits of democracy. Under me, Nigerians of all religions, ethnic groups and tongues will enjoy a government that will be truly of the people, a government that will be truly by the people, and a government that will truly be for the people, in delivering the dividends of democracy in line with our collective dreams and aspirations. “I come to serve. I come to wipe away tears. I come to be the humble steward of the hope, dignity, and good life that Nigerians have always hungered for. “I come to raise the heads of Nigerians high among the comity of nations. I come to restore confidence, dignity, and honour to the Green Passport. I come determined to take the bold steps necessary to give Nigerians the quality of life about which they have always dreamt. “In Nigeria’s diversity lies her strength. I aim therefore to be the apostle of unity in diversity, whereby the various ethno-regional units shall emphasise the strength of their individuality while maintaining the unblemished fabrics of a nation united under God. “The entire world has advanced into the digital epoch, we will therefore, be proactive in positioning Nigeria on the path of becoming a digital leader among the committee of Nations. “As much as we do not mean to dispense with the services of experienced technocrats and politicians, my government will headhunt the best of the abundant talents and resources in the youth and women population in a collaborative mission to push the nation into its deserved place on the world development map,” he said.
