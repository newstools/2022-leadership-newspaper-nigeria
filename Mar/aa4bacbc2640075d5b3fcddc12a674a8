President Muhammadu Buhari is yet to arrive at the venue of the ongoing national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), hence stalling the formal commencement of the event. The president, according to the programme of events for the convention, was supposed to arrive the Eagle Square venue of the convention by 3pm. So far there is no formal explanation on why the president has not arrived the venue. But as of 7pm, there was no sign of him even though some governors have arrived the venue just as most party delegates look tired and stressed out. Some of the governors present as of the time of filling this report are those of Kaduna, Ebonyi, Ekiti, Nasarawa Zamfara, Kogi, Yobe, and Lagos. Earlier, there was pandemonium at the entrance gate as delegates, journalists and other guests were teargassed by security operatives as they tried to gain entrance into the venue.
