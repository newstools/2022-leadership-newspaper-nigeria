A support group operating as Nigerian Youths for Tinubu has declared their endorsement of the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and pledged to buy the party’s presidential nomination form for him. Speaking to newsmen in Lagos, the convener of the group, Idris Aregbe said their decision to purchase his nomination form is informed by the strong belief across the country that he stands better qualified to fulfil the people’s best interests and hope, having proven himself a progressive, unifier, visionary and compassionate leader, a go-getter, detribalized Nigerian, human capital developer, a man who painstakingly listens to the people and is listened to. Aregbe said, “Nigeria needs a trusted and reliable visionary, who feels the pain and anguish of the people and is capable of making life better for us. I don’t think there is anyone as qualified as Tinubu today, and that is why we are behind him and ready the presidential nomination form for him.  “We are convinced, going by his track record as a progressive, about his victory and that informs our decision. Besides, it is also a way to stamp the legitimacy of youths on the presidential election process and we shall further ensure rigorous involvement of youths in the Tinubu presidency.’’  Giving further reasons for the project, the youth leader averred that, as a builder passionate about infrastructure, the former Lagos State governor not only laid the blueprint for infrastructure development of modern Lagos, but ensured the productivity of the state.  According to him, Lagos State remained a model amongst other states in the federation owing to the golden era of development ushered in by the Jagaban.
