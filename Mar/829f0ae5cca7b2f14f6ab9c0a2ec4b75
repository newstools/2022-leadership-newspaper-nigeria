German sportswear company, Adidas, has suspended its partnership with the Russian Football Union (RFS) with immediate effect, a company spokesperson said on Tuesday. The decision was in line with a series of those made by sports bodies to cut ties to Russian-affiliated bodies or companies following the war in Ukraine. Earlier, the UEFA also ended its sponsorship with Russian energy company, Gazprom. FIFA, the global football governing body, has asked Russia to play games without its national flag and national anthem at neutral venues. But thereafter, the FIFA went ahead and suspended Russia, who were the host of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. “Adidas is suspending its partnership with the Russian Football Federation (RFS) with immediate effect,” a spokesman of the company, was quoted as saying. The World Cup in Qatar is set to take place this year and FIFA’s decision regarding Russia’s participation remains to be seen. The International Olympics Committee (IOC) also recommended bans on Belarusian athletes. Belarus has helped Russia by allowing its territory to be used for military attacks. The IOC has also withdrawn Russian president, Vladimir Putin’s golden Olympic Order, which was awarded in 2001.
