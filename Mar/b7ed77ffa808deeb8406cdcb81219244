The Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Abubakar III, has called on traders to avoid increasing prices of foodstuff as the Muslim month of fasting approaches. Muslims across the world will observe a 30-day fasting period (Ramadan) beginning in April. The sultan made the call yesterday in Bauchi at the close of a week-long 2022 National Qur’an Recitation Competition hosted by the Bauchi State government in collaboration with Usman Dan Fodio University, Sokoto. He stressed the need for traders to be wary of the day of judgement and to avoid extortion of patrons. “I use this medium to call on all market people who sell things to be fearful of what Almighty God will ask them when they get to him on the day of judgement. “Instead of increasing prices of foodstuff and other essentials, please try to reduce the prices so as to get the blessing of Almighty God,’’ he said. The sultan, who is also the president-general of Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, urged governments at all levels to evolve measures to reduce the cost of living in the country. He lamented increasing cost of living, especially foodstuffs and called on government to try and reverse the trend by providing an enabling environment. (NAN)
