Ngige added that critical issues were deliberated with a timelines agreed for their implementations. Consequently, ASUU is expected to consult with its organs and get back to the federal government soon. “A lot of those issues have been deliberated and work in progress, we only have one or two areas and that area is condition of service negotiation, called 2009 agreements, the draft document has been produced within Ministry of Education. “So, the Ministry of Education has set up internal committee in their ministry to look at the product of that committee’s work. We have a timeline now, I say within six weeks, this committee in Education Ministry will round off everything and send to us,” Ngige said.
