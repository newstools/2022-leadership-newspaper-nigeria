Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) side, Lobi Stars of Makurdi, have named former Kano Pillars handler, Baba Ganaru, as their new head coach following the sacking of Coach Eddy Dombraye and his technical crew for poor performance. Coach Ganaru before his appointment had previously managed several NPFL clubs including Nasarawa United, Wikki Tourists and others. A press statement by the media officer of the Club, Uja Emmanuel, said Coach Ganaru has since assumed duty ahead of the second stanza of the Nigeria Professional Football League NPFL. Meanwhile, massive renovation work has commenced at the McCarthyStadium Wadata also Makurdi where players of the club are to be accommodated. The Vice Chairman of the Club, Dominic Iorfa, has directed all the Illegal occupants of the complex to vacate immediately. Recall that Iorfa, as the then Vice Chairman of the Club provided state-of -the-art facilities for the comfort of players 18 years ago, but since he left the club the stadium has been neglected.
