Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Cross River State has described the court sacking of 20 All Progressives Congress (APC) lawmakers who defected from the party as a welcome development. The two House of Representatives’ members affected by the ruling are Hon Mike Etaba and Hon Legor Idagbo  who represents Obubra/ Etung federal constituency, and Bekwarra /Obudu federal constituency respectively. They are joined by 18 members of the state House of Assembly who were also sacked by the court. Their sack followed a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/975/2021, which was filed by the PDP. Commenting on the judgement yesterday, the state PDP chairman, Barrister Venatius Ikem, called on other members of the APC to take advantage of the “April Transfer” season and return to the party. Ikem said the judgement of the court will be implemented and upheld by the appellate courts.
