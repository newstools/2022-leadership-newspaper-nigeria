The Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development has commenced a three-day capacity building workshop for registered non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and Voluntary Youth Organiaations (VYOs) at the Public Service Institute of Nigeria (PSIN), Abuja. The workshop was aimed at equipping registered NGOs and VYOs in the country with relevant skills and knowledge to operate effectively and efficiently. Declaring the workshop open on Monday, the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr Sunday Dare, said the workshop aside aiming at improving the capacities of the organisations, will expose them to the guidelines and criteria required for proper registration and recognition by the Ministry in line with the provisions of the National Youth Policy and other instruments on youth development, which recognise the very important role NGOs/VYOs have to play as partners in the implementation of youth development policies. The minister, who was represented by the permanent secretary, Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, Alhaji Ismaila Abubakar, reaffirmed the commitment of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to the success of the youth development mandate, saying the NGOs and VYOs have made enormous contributions to the promotion of national unity and integration as well as the acceleration of development in various spheres, including education, health, infrastructure, sports and social services, amongst others. “It has been observed that, due to the proliferation of NGOs/VYOs in the polity, efforts at achieving set objectives of the National Youth Policy have suffered setbacks and become so uncoordinated such that, proper evaluation/assessment of level of implementation of the Policy, as well as ascertaining the status of youth-serving organizations which are actively implementing various programmes of the Policy becomes difficult. “In order to reverse this trend, the Ministry thought it wise to organise a capacity building workshop for youth NGOs and VYOs so as to critically engage genuine dialogue and chart a new course on youth development work, as well as create a synergy with the Ministry for effective implementation of the National Youth Policy and other regional and international youth development instruments. “The Workshop will aim at improving your capacities, bringing you together for proper revalidation, coordination and synergy, as well as exposing you to the guidelines and criteria required for proper registration and recognition by the Ministry, in line with the provisions of the National Youth Policy and other Instruments on Youth Development which recognize the very important role Youth NGOs/VYOs have to play as partners in the implementation of youth development policies,” Dare said. Earlier, the secretary general of the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Barrister Abubakar Suleiman, commended the Ministry of Youth for organsing the workshop and urged the participating youths, NGOs and VYOs to put into practice all the knowledge that they will acquire from the three-day training exercise.
