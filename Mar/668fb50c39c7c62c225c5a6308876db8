The Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen, has disclosed that 232 women in Niger state are to benefit from the first batch of individual grant disbursement. The programme is a tripartite arrangement between World bank, Niger State and federal governments to help women overcome institutional and market failures limiting them from improving their socio-economic status and access to market. The minister explained at the flag off of the programme at Gawu Babangida in Gurara local government area of Niger state that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari secured support from the World Bank to help the women in this direction Mrs Tallen said that the project has trained, empowered and connected women to enhance livelihood opportunities through the establishment of Women Affinity Groups which she said Niger state has done excellently well. She declared “The women have been trained on how to save and boost their businesses. They have proofed that they are capable of running the businesses and we are confident they will not fail us because we started by raising funds within themselves and they raised over 400 million naira before this individual grant”, The Minister disclosed that 232 women are to benefit from the first batch of the disbursement with each having N60,000, while 875 are expected to benefit in the second batch of the grant which she said will take off soon. She said the Federal government is exploring ways to cover all the states of the Federation in the programme just as the National Cordinator Nigeria For Women Project Mrs Ruth Mshelia stated that the programme was targeting women drawn from six states across the six geopolitical zones of the country. She announced that Niger state came first in the performing chart out of the six implementing states with over 52,000 women beneficiaries in the state out of the 239,526 women targeted in the country and were able to save more among the implementing states. Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of the state who flagged off the first batch of  individual grant disbursement to women in Gawu Babangida, noted that the grant which is the second component of the project, was to serve as an incentive to improve the small businesses of the beneficiaries.  The Governor said his administration will continue to demonstrate commitment to payment of counterpart funds so as to attract more interventions to better the lives of the people especially the women as they are the bedrock of the families and the society.
