Apostle Prince Aniekan Etim has picked his expression of interest and nomination forms to contest the Akwa Ibom State governorship election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Etim obtained the forms at the Wadata Plaza national secretariat of the PDP in Abuja. Apostle Etim, a United States (US)-based development expert, who hails from Ikot Ekpene senatorial district of the state, after picking the forms promised to bring a lot of development to the state.  The aspirant who worked with the World Health Organisation (WHO), said his administration would focus in the areas of education, health, infrastructure, safety and security. “I am coming from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and I have vast knowledge in public services. I’m accessible to my people and I’m going to work on the economy of the state and make sure it becomes a strong one. So, we are going to help our people to grow and become stronger globally. “I also believe that PDP is going to find me worthy and give me the ticket. So, it is not all about wealth in Akwa Ibom,” he said. He added that he would bring the dividends of democracy to Akwa Ibom people.”
