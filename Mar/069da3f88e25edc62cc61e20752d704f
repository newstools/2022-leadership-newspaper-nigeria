This is just as the House promised to ensure a more effective accountability mechanism on the nation’s national resources. Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, while speaking at a public hearing on the need to recover the outstanding N2.6 trillion debt owed the federal government by oil and gas companies operating in the country yesterday, reiterated the commitment of the House to use legislative instruments to ensure transparency and accountability in managing public resources. The speaker said the House would not hesitate to evoke relevant legislative authority on any stakeholder that failed to cooperate in the exercise. Gbajabiamila insisted that the amount allegedly owed by 77 oil and gas companies would be enough to address long-standing developmental challenges, improve revenue and reduce borrowing to bridge the budget deficit. Chairman, Adhoc Committee on recovery of outstanding debts owed by oil and gas companies, Nkiruka Onyejeocha said the committee was ever ready to work with the Nigeria Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (NEITI) and ensure that all outstanding debt is paid to government coffers. In their separate submissions, NEITI and the Federal Inland Revenue Service confirmed the allegation, saying that already, some of the indicted companies have initiated a process to pay off the debt. A recent report by NEITI indicted some 77 oil and gas companies for owing the Nigerian government more than N2.6trillion ($6.2 billion) in royalties, charges and taxes.
