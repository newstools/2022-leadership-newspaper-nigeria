A presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Dele Momodu, has said the notion that a southern candidate cannot win the 2023 presidential election is total fallacy and absolute distortion of facts of history and Mathematics. Momodu, who secured his expression of interest and nomination forms yesterday at the PDP national secretariat, said it was practically and legally impossible for a party to disqualify an aspirant on account of zoning after collecting N40 million. Speaking with journalists after purchasing his forms, Momodu said Nigerians would no longer sell their souls for 20 pieces of silver. He therefore appealed to all men and women of good conscience to join him in stopping the rascality of those who feel Nigerians are permanently helpless and hopeless. He said; “We can rid ourselves of the manacles and shackles of the depressive state and oppressive nature created by much vaunted purported political demigods and warlords.”
