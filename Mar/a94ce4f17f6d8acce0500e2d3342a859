Director of Defence Information (DDI) Major General Jimmy Akpor has called on the media in Nigeria to support the military as it strives to secure and defend the country. He charged the media to strive to protect the hearts and minds of the people against fake news and misinformation as the military protects the country’s territorial space. Akpor who made the appeal when he visited the corporate headquarters of LEADERSHIP Newspaper in Abuja yesterday, said while the Armed Forces of Nigeria will be defending the nation’s territorial space, the media should do the non-kinetic aspect of the war. He said, “I still deem it necessary to visit you in your corporate headquarters to pay my courtesies and to solicit your usual support as we carry on with our constitutional roles as enshrined in section 217 of the constitution. “We’ll be defending and protecting the outer space, but there are areas where kinetic cannot reach, talking about the minds. “Whatever is sowed in the mind cannot be destroyed by kinetics. So you are the ones that govern that space, the media and LEADERSHIP occupy an enviable place in that sphere. “Therefore, I deemed it necessary to come and ask for usual cooperation with the media, especially with the management of LEADERSHIP Newspaper. That we own only one country, which is Nigeria and the responsibility to guide the soul of the country, lies in your purview. “Together we can collaborate to guide the physical and the soul of the country because this is the only country, we all have”. He lamented that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and smartphones have made military operations difficult. In his response, the vice chairman LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, Mr Mike Okpere said LEADERSHIP would continue to support the military in line with its motto; “For God and Country.” He said, “We welcome you whole heartedly. We want to assure you that like our motto ‘For God and Country’ we’ll continue to hold unto that.”
