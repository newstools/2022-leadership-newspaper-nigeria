The deputy senate president said the senators have graced the unveiling of the campaign headquarters to show their support and solidarity for Senator Adamu, because of his various contributions to the development of the party. He maintained that if Senator Abdullahi Adamu is elected as the national chairman of the APC, the party would win the forthcoming general election in the country.
