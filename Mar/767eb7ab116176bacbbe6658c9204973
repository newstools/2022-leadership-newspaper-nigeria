Justice Nyang Ekwo of a Federal High Court in Abuja, has adjourned to April 27, 2022 for definite hearing in the case filed by the attorney general of the federation and minister of justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, seeking to extradite deputy commissioner of police in charge of Intelligence Response Team, DCP Abba Kyari. The AGF had filed an application seeking to extradite Kyari to the United States of America, to face trial alongside alleged fraudster, Ramon Abass aka Hushpuppi and other accomplices who were involved in internet fraud. When the case came up in court, Justice Ekwo ordered parties to exchange their briefs and return to the court on the next adjourned date to argue their briefs. There were reports that the office of the AGF had made a U-turn on the case. But the AGF, Abubakar Malami, SAN, denied the reports. It was reported that the office of the AGF issued a new legal advice exonerating Kyari from money laundering allegations. The office of the AGF had in its first legal advice admitted that a prima facie case of money laundering of 33 payments was established by the late DIG Joseph Egbunike-led Special Investigation Panel against Kyari has now said, there are no links with Kyari following further investigations. Kyari and others are facing criminal charges in court over involvement in drugs and money laundering allegations The new legal advice with reference number, DPPA/LA/814/21, written on behalf of the AGF by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Ministry of Justice, Mohammed Abubakar, emphasized that the evidence contained in the case diary had no link between DCP Abba Kyari and Hushpuppi. It said the evidence contained in the case diary was not sufficient to indicate or show that the said monies (N279million) were laundered directly or indirectly by Kyari to disguise their origin’ adding that the police report on the investigation failed to probe the gaps identified in their investigation by the AGF office.
