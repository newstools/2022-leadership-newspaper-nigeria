Apparently unperturbed by attacks against his reelection bid, governor of Osun State Gboyega Oyetola has said that his achievements in various sectors in the state in more than three years in office will speak for him, and ensure his reelection come July 16 gubernatorial election. Oyetola said this during an engagement programme with state’s Barbers Association on Wednesday at Orita Elelede in Olorunda local government area of the state. Represented by his special adviser on civic engagement, Hon Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, the governor said with the available meagre resources at his disposal, he had put smiles on the faces of the people in the state. Oyetola, who commended the people of the state for the huge support given to his administration since inception, urged them not to allow greedy politicians to destroy the giant strides the state had made. The governor said that he would never be distracted by political machinations, but would focus on quality service delivery to the people, adding that the will of God would prevail through the popular support of the people who had been the centerpiece of his administration. Oyetola, who said he would not spare any effort in advancing the pace of good governance, which his administration had instituted for the masses, stressed that people remained behind him and would return him to office in the next election. In his remarks, the president of the association, Mr Sunday Obafemi, commended the governor on his people-oriented programmes and policies, which is affecting the masses positively.
