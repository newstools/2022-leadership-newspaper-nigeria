President Muhammadu Buhari has joined the Obasi family, Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) and Nigeria Guild of Editors (NGE) in mourning the passing of the publisher of Hallmark Newspapers, Prince Emeka Obasi. The President in a statement by his media aide, Femi Adesina, also commiserated with friends and professional colleagues, especially members of the Newspaper Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN) over the sad loss of the veteran journalist and administrator, who served as Commissioner of Information in Abia State. President Buhari affirmed that Prince Obasi lived a patriotic life, contributing to the growth of the nation and welfare of citizens, setting up legacies like the Public Policy Research and Analysis Centre (PPRAC), which organises the annual Zik Prize in Leadership Awards. President Buhari, therefore, prayed that God will accept the soul of the departed, and comfort all those who mourn him.
