Award winning Nigerian singer and philanthropist, David Adeleke also known as Davido is set to give N20million to 20 young entrepreneurs. This gesture comes shortly after the Nigerian multiple award-winning singer stated via his verified Twitter handle that ‘Nigerians should pray’ due to the large sum of money he used to ship his recently acquired Lamborghini car. The singer also took to his official Twitter page on Wednesday to lament the hardship in the country and what people were going through. Demonstrating that he cares and to alleviate their hardship, the popstar further stated that he was going to give out N20m to 20 people on Friday to aid their businesses. Davido tweeted, “Country hard right now sha … let’s give N20m to 20 people on Friday… send in your business ideas or start-up ideas … more details shortly #Wrblo”. The singer who just had a successful concert at O2 Arena in London, has a mantra, ‘We rise by lifting others’. In November, 2021, Davido doled out N200million that was contributed to the singer by his colleagues and friends, in addition to his own money, to clear his Lamborghini, to some orphanages across the country.
