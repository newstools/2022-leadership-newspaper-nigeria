 Nwosu spoke while narrating his motivation towards establishing an electrical appliances shop for one Chibuzom Uchendu, whom he came across his pathetic story on social media. He said there are many Chibuzo’s across the country, while urging other well meaning Nigerians to please, support young people around them so that little by little, poverty can be eradicated in Nigeria.  “Sometime last week, while I was surfing through the social media, I came across a young man named Chibuzom Uchendu from Ogwa, Mbaitoli Local Government Area of Imo State. “While reading the story, I discovered that this young man was involved in an accident that led to the amputation of one of his legs.  “I also saw that despite his condition, that he is actively engaged in mason work, going from one construction site to another so that he could fend for himself without resorting to crime or begging. “I was amazed, seeing another Nigerian youth who exhibited the “Never Give Up Spirit” which Africans around the world are endowed with. “Immediately, I picked up interest in him and requested for his contact details and finally scheduled to meet him and his family members.  “Upon meeting with my dear Chibuzom, yesterday, he told me about his dreams of owning a business where he could sell electrical appliances.  “Impressed by his ambition, I therefore gave approval for my foundation, the Ugwumba Leadership Center to release funds immediately for the establishment of an electrical appliances shop for him in Owerri,” he added.
