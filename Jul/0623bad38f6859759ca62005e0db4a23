The plots of land were offered to Obi by the Anambra State Housing Development Corporation under the leadership of Mike Nwafor as the agency’s managing director. However, a viral letter personally written by former Governor Obi, dated May 8, 2007, and addressed to Nwafor, indicated that Obi turned down the offer. In the letter, titled, ‘Allocation of Two Plots of Land: Plot 29/L255 And Plot 29/L254’, sighted by LEADERSHIP, Obi said that he became a governor by the grace of God, hence he believed that it was wrong to benefit from that.  The letter reads: “I write to acknowledge receipt of your letters of 07/5/07 and 13/02/07 with the reference numbers of EDA 19/Vol. IV and EDA 40/Vol/1, conveying the allocation of two plots of land – Plot 29/L255 and Plot 29/L254 – at the Hill View Estate, Nkwelle-Ezenaka to me. “However, as I have made abundantly clear, my being the governor is by the Grace of God and I believe firmly that it is wrong to benefit from that. “I became the governor because I wish to serve my people, and to do that devotedly, I believe I have to distance myself from undue privileges of the office. “Consequently, as I thank you for your thoughtfulness, I wish to decline the allocation based on the reasons already adduced.”
