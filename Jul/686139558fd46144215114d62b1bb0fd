 LEADERSHIP Weekend recalls that the dockworkers under the aegis of Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN), had picketed the terminal on Wednesday, shut down the terminals, alleging refusal of the terminal operator to review the workers’ Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), which is usually reviewed annually.  The strike, however, made vessels scheduled for discharge of cargoes stranded while already cleared containers to be moved out of the APM Terminals Apapa, remained trapped in the last two days.  Speaking with LEADERSHIP Weekend, the president General, MWUN, Com. Adewale Adeyanju, said the issues that led to the strike had been resolved.
According to him, the union and the terminal operator reached an agreement in resolving some of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) adding that workers are to resume operational activities immediately.
He commended management of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and the executive secretary, Nigerian Shippers’ Council, Emmanuel Jime, for the prompt intervention to the save the nation’s economy.
He reiterated the union’s commitment towards ensuring industrial peace and harmony in the shipping industry.
