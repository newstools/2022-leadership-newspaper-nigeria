 Beyioku, who was reacting to an unfortunate outburst by Ezinne Abba, blaming the Federation and minister of youth and sports development, Chief Sunday Dare, for her inability to make Team Nigeria’s list to the World Athletics Championships, says Abba can’t force herself into the team after failing to compete in any individual event at the Nigerian Championships in Benin City last month. ‘Miss Abba did not compete in any individual event at the Nigerian Championships in Benin City which was used as selection trials for both the World Athletics Championships and the Commonwealth Games. ‘Miss Abba has not also completed the mandatory three out of competition tests for the championships as she was not under the radar of the Nigerian anti-doping agency until recently when her change of allegiance from the United States of America to Nigeria was granted by World Athletics’. ‘The AFN is appalled that Miss Abba has dragged the Honourable Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Chief Sunday Dare into a matter that is 100% at the discretion of the AFN. The Sports Ministry does not interfere in the running of the Federation. ‘She should have known her selection is not automatic and must explain why she chose to publicly drag the name of the AFN and the Sports Minister in an inappropriate manner,” ,” AFN scribe said. Beyioku says representing Nigeria is subject to meeting laid down rules and regulations. The AFN will not condone any misguided outburst from any athlete.
