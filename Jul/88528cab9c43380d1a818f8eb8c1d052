A two-time member of the National Assembly, Senator Dino Melaye, has appealed to the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Peter Obi, to wait for his “time” in order to achieve his presidential ambition.  Melaye, who is currently in the United States of America, made the appeal in a video posted on his verified Facebook page on Friday.  He said while the majority of the former Anambra State governor’s campaign dwells on reducing the cost of governance, Nigerian challenges were beyond just reducing the cost of governance.  The former Kogi West Senator also said while Obi is a potential president of Nigeria, the time was not right for him to actualise his presidential ambition, adding that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, was the right person for the job presently.  “By the grace of God he (Obi) has the potential of being the president in the nearest future. I celebrate you and I celebrate your movement for a new Nigeria. While I celebrate you, I want to advise you that your time is not now. You have to wait for your time.  “I have listened to your postulations, arguments, deliveries, and campaigns and I can say 90 per cent of your campaigns are dwelling on reducing the cost of governance.  “You are a great Nigerian and I salute your political and intellectual sagacity. You are one Nigerian that I know that tomorrow, there’s a space for you. But for today, let us forget the social media drama and Diaspora euphoria.  “The truth of the matter is that we need a unifier and a Nigerian than can solve the problem of insecurity and that will have intel from every security facet of our national life. We need a Nigerian that will get intel from Cameroon, Mali, Chad, Benin Republic and others.  “We need a Nigerian that has that capacity to solve the problem of Boko Haram, bandits, and others because he has intel from all the neighboring countries and that Nigerian today is Atiku Abubakar,” Melaye stated.
