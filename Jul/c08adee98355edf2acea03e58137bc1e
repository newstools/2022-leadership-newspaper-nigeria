 The managing director of Coleman, Mr. George Onafowokan stated that the Company will commission its Fibre-Optic Cable Factory on June 14, 2022 at Ogun State.  He said the drive is to have a localised fibre optic manufacturer in Nigeria and particularly to provide jobs for thousands of people. “This plant and the technical know-how are being done in collaboration with the largest fiber-optic producer in the world Corning Inc., who are the biggest and largest producers of fiber in the world,” Onafowokan said. He stressed that prices of cables remain extremely competitive due to the localisation of production in the country.  “Furthermore, we are also exploring the opportunity to provide certain required accessories such as patch cords, splice closures, and pigtails, which we believe are necessary items to the value chain required for fiber cable users,” the company disclosed,” the MD said.  The dignitaries expected at the commissioning include Ogun State Governor, Mr. Dapo Abiodun, Marybeth Leonard U.S.A Ambassador to Nigeria, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantanmi, Minister of Industries, Trade, and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite, among others.
