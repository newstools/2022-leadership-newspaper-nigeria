Former Senator representing Rivers South-East senatorial district in the National Assembly, Senator Magnus Ngei Abe, has said although he has since left the Rivers State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the resignation letter currently circulating around was not from him. Abe disclosed this on Wednesday while speaking on a live programme on Arise News Television, which was monitored in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. He declared his continued support to the ambition of the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, adding that he has no issues with the former Lagos State governor. Abe said: “I have since left APC in Rivers State but the letter circulating round is not from me. I am still with Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and has no issue with him whatsoever. “I am strongly in support of Asiwaju but I am not part of APC in Rivers State and the charade going on there.” Recall that the social media space has been awash since Tuesday with copies of saresignation letter, purportedly written by Abe and addressed to the APC national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu. The letter, which was not dated, reads in part: “I wish to tender my resignation of membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC). “My decision to quit is not unconnected with Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s seeming unwillingness  to negotiate with me since he expects me to remain in the APC. Hence my resolve to seek alternative platform to actualize my Gubernatorial Ambition in Rivers State. “I feel it is time to move on with my Ambition, having served this country as Lawmaker in the Rivers State House of Assembly, SSG of Rivers State, and Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “Let me also use this moment to thank my teeming supporters, and some of those that defected from the APC,  for standing by me in all these years, more importantly H.E  Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “In the coming days, I shall tell Nigerians my next political decision. Thank you.”
