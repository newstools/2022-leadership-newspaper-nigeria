Nigeria’s Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Hon. Sunday Dare has felicitated all sports journalists in Nigeria and beyond, as the world marks the 2022 International Sports Journalists Day. The Minister, who is a journalist himself, stated that the profession is reserved for noble personalities who work round the clock, all year-round to give sports the needed coverage it needs to blossom. Dare said, “this day deserves to be celebrated, as I am a sports journalist myself, and I know the efforts and passion sports journalists put in their job daily. Sports Journalism is my constituency because it is where I started from and the profession brought me to the limelight. “Today, I doff my heart and celebrate sports journalists, who have made immeasurable sacrifices for sports across the globe, especially in Nigeria. Sports Journalists in Nigeria rank very highly amongst the professionals in Nigeria who invest so much passion into their jobs, no matter what they face. You have not paid attention to the hazards of the job, but instead you have chosen to be partners in the development of sports. This in itself calls for celebration and I join in this celebration,” the Minister added. This year’s event is themed ‘Securing a Sustainable and Peaceful Future For All’ and is celebrated by sports journalists, media organisations and related industries all around the globe since 1994.
