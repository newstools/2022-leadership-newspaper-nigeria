 Following last week performance, analysts expected cautious trading on stock market to continue for the three days trading, as bargain hunting and indecisiveness by investors trail the market.  Also, they expected mixed trading in the midst of bargain hunting and portfolio reshuffling, ahead of the interim dividend season and second-half of the year, while investors digest the March audited accounts released.   Analysts Optimism In the new week, analysts at Cordros Securities Limited said: “with the moderation in the prices of bellwether stocks this week, we expect savvy investors to take advantage of this and make re-entry ahead of the first half (H1), 2022 earnings season.
“However, we do not rule out the possibility of continued profit-taking activities. As a result, we think the local bourse will likely exhibit a choppy pattern. Therefore, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks.”
Analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited, stated that, “in the new week, the anticipation of first half (H1), 2022 results are expected to act as catalyst to trigger more bullish sentiments. Also, we continue to maintain positive sentiments in the market while investors are advised to trade on companies’ stocks with good fundamentals and a positive outlook so as to avoid falling into the bear trap.”   Last Week’s Trading Activities In the just concluded week, the Nigerian equities market ended on a bearish note from the prior week in four out of five trading sections due to continued sell-off in some stocks by investors who are beginning to position for the earning season.
