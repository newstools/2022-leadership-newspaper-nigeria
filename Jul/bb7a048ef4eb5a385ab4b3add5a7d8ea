 The rally will be held at the Osogbo Township Stadium. Already, Governors Ifeanyi Okowa, Godwin Obaseki, Aminu Tambuwal, Duoye Diri of Delta, Edo, Sokoto, Bayelsa respectively were said to have arrived in the state as of the time of filing this report. Though the rally is scheduled to begin from 11:00 am today, the coast is still not clear on whether the party has been granted permission to use the proposed venue as of the time of filing this report. When contacted earlier, the commissioner of information and strategy, Mrs Funke Egbemode, said the venue had been allocated before the leadership of PDP approached the government for the use of the venue.  However, PDP members have started arriving in Osogbo from across the 30 local governments of the state.  Meanwhile, presidential candidate of Labour Party, Mr Peter Obi has charged the Osun electorate to vote enmasse for Hon.Lasun Yussuff to ensure productivity and dividends of democracy in the state.  Addressing party supporters at a rally yesterday in Osogbo, where he handed over the party’s flag to Yussuff, the Labour Party candidate, Obi described him as a thoroughly bred politician with intimidating credentials that would deliver on the people’s aspirations. He lamented the precarious situation Nigerians have been subjected to by the dominant political parties in Nigeria, adding that it was the right time for Nigerians to set themselves free and vote for a better alternative that can be found in LP. Obi expressed the need for Nigerians to be shown love and compassion which he said the dominant parties lacked as manifested in the way they treat the youths, the workers and the entire citizens of Nigeria. Also speaking, the candidate of the party, Hon. Lasun Yussuff said he is better equipped to govern Osun State because he has what it takes to govern successfully having served as deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives.
