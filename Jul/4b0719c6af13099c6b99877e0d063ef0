The Senegal international won the prize ahead of former Liverpool teammate, Mohamed Salah and compatriot, Edouard Mendy of Chelsea. After claiming the prestigious prize at the CAF Awards ceremony in Rabat on Thursday’s night, Mane became the fifth player after El Hadji Diouf, Samuel Eto’o, Yaya Toure, and Salah to win the award in consecutive years since CAF took over the distribution of the award in 1992. Mane propelled the Lions of Teranga of Senegal to win their maiden Africa Cup of Nations – scoring the crucial penalty that downed Egypt inside Olembe Stadium in Yaounde, Cameroon early this year. In the female category, Nigeria’s Asisat Oshoala saw off competition from Cameroon’s Ajara Nchout Njoya and Zambia’s Grace Chanda, to be crowned the queen of African football for a record fifth time in a row. The triumph surpasses Perpetua Nkwocha, a former Falcons striker’s record, who won the award four times in a row. The Barcelona forward had been adjudged the best African female football in 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2019. Senegal and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Pape Matar Sarr picked the Young Player of the Year Award ahead of Hannibal Mejbri (Tunisia & Manchester United) and Karim Konate (Cote d’Ivoire & ASEC/RB Salzburg).
