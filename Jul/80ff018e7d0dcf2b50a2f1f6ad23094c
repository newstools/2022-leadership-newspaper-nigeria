Italian Prime Minister, Mario Draghi, is to resign hours after populist coalition partner, Five Star, withdrew its support in a major confidence vote. The former head of the European Central Bank has led a unity government since February 2021. In a statement, he said the pact of trust that had sustained the unity government had gone. “I will hand my resignation to the president of the republic this evening,” he said.
