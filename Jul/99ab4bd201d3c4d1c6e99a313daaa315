 Semifinal opponent Nick Kyrgios will receive a walkover into Sunday’s final, where he will play either top seed and six-time champion Novak Djokovic or Britain’s Cameron Norrie.  Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam champion, struggled with the injury in a gruelling five-set win against 11th-seeded American Taylor Fritz on Wednesday. “I have to pull out of the tournament. As everybody saw yesterday I have been suffering with the pain in the abdominal area,” he said. “I have a tear in the muscle.” Nadal, the second seed, was visibly in pain during his match with Fritz and was forced to take a medical time-out in the second set. But he returned to the court and twice recovered from a set down to win 3-6, 7-5, 3-6, 7-5, 7/6 (10/4) in four hours and 21 minutes.
